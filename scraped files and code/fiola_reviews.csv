"Norry H.","2/22/2014","Washington, DC","""L'amore al primo morso!"" I really really love this place! Fiola Mare is THE place for authentic and classy Italian cooking and fresh seafood lovers! I am giving a perfect 5 with much confidence at my first visit right now. From the personal greeting by the elegant Maria Trabocchi, to Maine Peektoe Crab antipasti, to my half portion Bucatini with Red King Prawns and Sea Urchin, and finally to the dessert Baba al Rhum, everything and I mean ""everything"" was impeccable. Our lady bartender was very nice and knowledgeable too.",5,11,1,8
"Adrienne K.","2/22/2014","Arlington, VA","The menu was the most thoughtful and creative selection I've ever seen. You could tell that each ingredient was really considered and carefully sourced to create a special dining experience. The Bucatini was amazing and the wine pairings suggested to us were just right.",5,2,0,1
"bill s.","3/2/2014","Washington, DC","Two dinners so far.  Fabio is a master chef. The restaurant is beautiful. Unlike so many restaurants these days it is relatively quiet.  All the food I have tried so far is excellent. Prices are moderate to expensive. Motivation to earn more money. Lobster and lobster Ravioli are standouts.  Smoked Black Cod fish is fantastic. Oysters with caviar and creme was to die for. Enjoy",5,2,1,1
"Bryan M.","3/3/2014","Arlington, VA","Great new restaurant and finally a chance to get some great food on the Georgetown Waterfront.  Don't be scared, this is not the below average Tony & Joe's or Sequoia that are just relying on water views. Went there on a Saturday night with my wife and had a wonderful dinner. Lots of very interesting, well thought out menu items. The lump crab cake salad was wonderful. So too the lobster ravioli and ahi tuna appetizer. Servers were knowledgeable and recommended good wine pairings. Great dinner all around and when the weather warms up, will offer outdoor seating along the river.",5,1,0,0
"John L.","3/3/2014","Arlington, VA","We love Fiola, and think it's one of the best Italian restaurants we've been to in the U.S. so we had to try Fiola Mare for brunch Sunday and, unfortunately, it does not currently live up to the standards of its companion restaurant BUT I'm sure it will improve and I'll be happy to upgrade my rating at that time.Service:  Everyone was nice but we received incorrect dishes and occasionally the waiter would miss a drink order and we would have to order again.  Nothing major and something that should be cleaned up in the future but also something I wouldn't except from a Fiola property.Food:   Food was fine, certain dishes better than others.  The poached eggs, when cooked properly, were excellent but unfortunately, the two eggs on our plates were unevenly poached (one overdone) which was unexpected.  Setting:  Excellent setting with views of the Potomac.  We will go back and hopefully have a better time.",3,1,0,0
"Adam L.","3/4/2014","Arlington, VA","My god, the food here is fantastic.  Went with a medium sized group to brunch this weekend and I can't say enough about the quality of the food. We had both traditional brunch foods and some seafood dishes, all of which were great both in portion sizes and quality.Service: absolutely awful.  Our waiter had an attitude as soon as we walked in.  There were less than 50 people dining in the entire restaurant, and had to be about 12-15 staff there.  I've never seen that many people walking around doing a terrible job.  Our waiter came by VERY rarely, drinks took an extremely long time to arrive.  We had to flag him down to take our order after the appetizer plates had been cleared for over ten minutes. At the end of the meal, even though we had written down amounts to charge to our cards, he was unable to split the check correctly, charging over $200 more than what was on the tab.Overall, the brunch took almost 3.5 hours from the time we showed up to when we left.  The ""Wine Manager"" came over to apologize for the wait, handing us his card and inviting us to call him if we needed anything. Not sure how helpful that is, but maybe we can give him a ring for wine suggestions when we head to whole foods.The Chef and the water guy were great.  I feel bad for the folks in the kitchen because the food they put out is incredible.Would go again...for takeout.",2,6,0,0
"Cyndy K.","3/8/2014","Honolulu, HI","Cyndy's Bottom Line:  Excellent service by Arturo (sp?) and delicious Italian inspired seafood dishes in a beautiful setting. 4.75 stars for the food.5 stars for service5 stars for ambianceThere is valet service which is located at the front entrance 31st and K.  We missed the entrance and the valet and went into the public parking garage.  Will definitely use the valet on our next visit.  They are so friendly and nice!I love the location on the Georgetown waterfront with spectacular beautiful views of the water and the outlying area.We were taken to our table and were so lucky to have a booth that is facing the water and to be in Arturo's section.I started with a glass of Prosecco, Le Vigne di Alice, Doro, Brut Superiore, Veneto, Italy.  Divine bubbles!Hubby had the Redemption Rye Manhattan.Arturo recommend a bottle of the Isole e Olena, Tuscany 2012 to pair with our food.  It was excellent.Arturo explained the entire menu to us.  Provided great passionate descriptions of all the dishes. We selected most of Arturo's recommendations:1.  Catalina Sea Urchin Panna Cotta -Foie Gras, Espelette, Sake Infused Caviar Squid Ink Brioche.  Creaminess of the panna cotta with the urchin is brilliant!  The brioche was so useful to soak up all of the panna cotta.  2.  Quinault Tribe Wild Razor Clams Roman Puntarelle & Anchovies DressingBeautiful presentation of a salad.  The razor clams were sweet and succulent.  The anchovies were a perfect compliment to the razor clams.  The dressing was light not to over power the fresh flavor of the seafood.3.  Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella - Baby Artichokes, Anchovies, Sea Lettuce, Cucumbers, Pesto of Basil Genovese.We shared this dish and it was plated separately.  Love the attention to detail.  The burrata was creamy with perfect texture.  A delicious refreshing salad.4.  Fiola Maine Lobster Ravioli - Ginger, Chives.  Magnificent!  The raviolis were nicely stuffed with delightful lobster and the wrappers were so delicate.   They melt in your mouth.5.  Smoked Potato Gnocchi - Wild Turbot, Baby Artichokes, Almonds, Italian Parsley.I enjoyed the components of this dish except for the smokiness which I thought was a bit too intense and it tasted too herbaceous for my palate.  The turbot was done perfectly.We had to cancel our next order because we were way to full and I was saving room for the bomboloni.6.  Ricotta Bomboloni Burnt Honey Gelato - every bite is so divine!  It is so yummy with the gelato.  The next visit I will order it first to go with my prosecco!7.  Baba al Rhum - Vanilla Crema, Pear Marmellata, Toasted Alba Hazelnuts.  Decadence!!!  The vanilla crema was so lusciously delicious all by itself.  The pear was yummy sweetness.8.  Macarons and almond cookies - a nice touch to a wonderful time!",4,4,0,1
"Lillie Z.","3/9/2014","Washington, DC","One of the best overall restaurants I've been to in terms of food and ambiance! I seriously cannot rec it enough.The ahi tuna crudo is to diiiiie for AMAZING. Like you absolutely have to have it. Seriously. The tuna slices are huge fatty sashimi style. Incredibly fresh and unbelievably flavorful. It comes with a rich citrus dressing salad blend with light greens and thick blood orange rounds on top of a light fluffy and just crispy enough pancake like bread. Oh my god. So good. Basically an entire meal and a good size to share too. The raw crudo scallops are also delicious. Very very well and thickly seasoned! The scallops basically melt in your mouth and have the consistency between jello and giant tapioca - kind of reminiscent of rice noodle rolls. melty, chewy, slimy, but also solid. I swear it tastes a lot better than the description would suggest...The colors of the garden salad with heirloom radicchio and blood oranges and tangerines was beautifully done and delicious (they split it in two for us) but also incredibly underwhelming compared to everything else. (Also see my Fiola review bc I basically had a kale salad there that MADE MY LIFE and no salad since has compared). Caviar with froth was delicious but the staging of the caviar could have been done much better. The gnocchi was great if you like gnocchi but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're craving gnocchi. If you want pasta go for the lobster ravioli as many reviewers would recommend. Whoops.The passion fruit and seasoned fruit sorbet took FOREVER to get to us. Very passion fruity - the sorbet was perfect. The seasoned fruit was soggy and peaches I think which...it's March? Is that seasonal? They also gave us pistachio-flavored cookie balls or something to end the night, complementary. HOLY MOTHER DELICIOUS. I'm pretty sure it's an actual dessert too so order that!Service was great. The waiter was attentive but not overly so. The food was staged and plated and served at exactly the right time. They paid attention to when we finished but not in an awkward gawking at us way.  Our plates were taken away professionally (a little awkwardly bc we were snuggling and they came in from behind us as is most professional so we kind of threw them off. whoops) and everyone was wonderful, smily, professional, and (almost) seamless. The service got a little slow towards the end... But otherwise was great. All in all. I WILL BE BACK. Especially as the menu changes to try new things. The food was amazing, everything they do they do well, and they have absolute standouts as well. I would absolutely recommend talking to the waiter and getting his/her recs though. Their entire restaurant is GORGEOUS. *GORGEOUS*. The seating is exquisite and comfy. We went early enough that they allowed us to take the four seater table with the cushioned benches. The bar is beautiful and have nice seats if you want to go early and lounge. The bar menu is extensive for those who want to drink.",5,4,5,6
"A B.","3/10/2014","Arlington, VA","Food was delicious and creative, but the service needs to improve.  I had the frutta di mare salad and the grilled dorado with roasted lemon.  I would recommend those dishes.This is an upscale place, but some of the details have not been very well thought out.   I did not like sitting in the adjacent sunroom area, but my husband did not seem to mind.  He thought it was cozy.  I would have preferred sitting in the main restaurant with more plush and comfortable seating.  Someone should think through the playlist and lower the music volume.  The Jem soundtrack that came before the house music was a little weird.  To the Manager: whatever you choose, please make it complement your delicious food and not drown out conversation.  Kitchen was slow, although our server was prompt and accommodating.  Servers need to communicate with each other (we were asked by two different servers what drinks we would be ordering on two occasions).I would like to try again in several months.  This is a welcome addition to the waterfront and I think with more time, the details will hopefully sort themselves out.",3,0,0,1
"Richard K.","3/15/2014","New York, NY","New restaurant in Washington Harbour...highly recommend giving it a shot.  The fresh fish was amazing (we had dover sole).  Place is new and service was just so so...I hope to go back and upgrade my ratings.",4,0,0,0

"Sara J.","3/17/2014","Washington, DC","Really perfect all around.Decor: warm, upscale, ""in"", romantic, but also has an air of power player.Menu and fare: I wanted to try everything but having just had a baby, started with oysters (Washington, Cape Cod and Duxbury) that were distinct, fresh, and accompanied by two sweet citrusy vinegars that I wanted to drink in with a straw! Main course was a  delicious seafood stew over creamy polenta -- to die for -- as was my husband's lobster ravioli with ginger butter. Desserts were also a hit--a lemon meringue torte and a dense chocolate mint and pistachio cake. Service: attentive, personal but not too in our faces. Fiola Mare is lovely and worth the priciness, especially if you can watch Chef Fabio conduct the symphony of staff and cuisine with a very serious attention to detail and timing.",5,1,0,1
"Jessica M.","3/20/2014","Old Town Alexandria, Alexandria, VA","This is another amazing Fiola restaurant on the Georgetown waterfront, when the weather is warmer it's going to have an amazing open patio overlooking the river. I enjoyed a savory pasta and scallop dish with the perfect bottle of Italian white wine. There is also a lovely room for events that seats about 15 people. Make you reservations now otherwise you will miss out!",5,0,0,0
"Maria B.","3/24/2014","Washington, DC","This was just so perfect, I'm hesitant to describe it too much because I won't do it justice. Just take the 5 star review, all your money, and go. This is such a cool location on the Georgetown waterfront, but away from the main drag and all the summer drunks. They really did it justice with the buildout. It feels very open and simple but still upscale. I can't wait to sit on the patio once the weather is nice.The service was fantastic. As you expect from a place like this, I must have gone through 10 silverware setups and the table was wiped down between courses, but that's really not what made the service special. It was the ease with which our server (and the entire team that worked with her) let herself into our meal just enough to be pleasant and upbeat and beyond knowledgeable, but made it not about her or her personality or her script. She let the food do the talking, and talk it did. I had just about everything on the menu... That's not an exaggeration, we were at the chef's table and had course after course of deliciousness. I can say without equivocation that there was not a single sub-par dish, but more than that, everything was inventive and fresh and just top notch. This is a chef who knows about acid. I won't go through everything but do have a few highlights. Order the frutti di mare... their seafood is fresh and flavorful and at a place like this, how can you not get the sampler platter?!I would order the hamachi every single time I come here. It was that good. Fresh, unexpected and really a perfect bite, but if you're not into a super fishy taste just eat it without the roe. The same with the burrata salad. WOW. I have never never had burrata this good outside of Italy and it paired perfectly with the cucumber salad and all the other goodness in that bowl. I'd come back for dinner at the bar and just order that and a glass of wine... but that would be a mistake because everything else is just so fantastic. The pasta is what you'd expect from Fabio Trabbochi. In a word: perfect. The actual pasta really stands out - the dishes are perfectly sauced. Order the Lobster Ravioli and any of the other pastas. I'd eat the cavatelli every night if I could. They fillet the fish right at your table. The chef and the servers are happy to suggest which to order. I loved the dorade and black cod. Save room, if at all possible, for the bomboloni, which are powdered ricotta donut holes, and the rum cake. If you have to choose one, the rum cake is the winner. Spumoni was fabulous too and if i were coming back in the summer, that would be my one thing I'd order for dessert.",5,7,1,4
"Mila M.","3/24/2014","Portland, OR","I want to give Fiola Mare the five stars it deserves, but our experience fell short. The food was flawless -- lobster ravioli and the risotto were wonderful and well-worth the $30-$35 pricetags. However, the service fell very flat. We went through several servers, none of which seemed to warm him or herself up to us, so we didn't even know who we ended up tipping. We were also overcharged for our dinner bill -- our servers didn't communicate the two drinks we had at the bar while waiting for our table had already been paid for. The admin staff was easy to work with regarding resolving this problem.Truly a wonderful experience especially on a sunny, warm day, but beware of slow service and overcharges.",3,0,0,0
"Mali A.","3/28/2014","McLean, VA","About time to have a nice restaurant on the waterfront. The food was fantastic special the Lobster Ravioli but the portions for the price was very small.

"Sholeh S.","3/29/2014","Great Falls, VA","Made reservations from 3 weeks before they opened up on Open Table.  Specified that it was a dear friends birthday.  We were seated 20 minutes late because they wouldn't give us the table we wanted.  They said that it was reserved, meanwhile no one was sitting there.  Also they specified they can only take requests but not guarantee it.  Make that kind of exception for your guests not a good way to start.  They did try to please us after 20 minutes wait.  Gave us a table for 4 and cramped 5 of us on it.  Service is slow.  We sat for another 15 minutes before wine and bread came along. We paid $600 for 5 people and couple of us left hungry.  A restaurant with a great location and breath taking view, so if money is not an issue go there but request a table with water view because you just might get it if you are lucky and you know the owner.  :)",3,2,0,0
"Stephanie B.","3/30/2014","Rockville, MD","It just didn't live up to expectations for a $$$$ restaurant.  Service was very SLOW.  Two hours for one round of cocktails, oysters, a prosecco sorbet amuse busche, pasta entrees, and dessert.  To their credit, dessert was gratis for the slow service.Highlight of the meal was my husband's scallop and ravioli in a foie gras sauce.  Yum!  Bread was never served, but we ended up asking for it to soak up that sauce.The staff wasn't terribly familiar with the three types of oysters available that evening, stating that they change nightly.  Bummer, considering we dropped nearly $60 on oysters.  It made me miss Farrallon, San Francisco, another high end seafood restaurant that has done a much better job recommending oysters from a selection of about 10.If you're looking to not drop a crazy amount of $$$$, avoid the cocktails.  They come in very small martini glasses for $14.  You may be better off getting a glass of wine instead.  Also, valet is $20.  We parked ourselves in the garage for $12; the restaurant doesn't validate.Bottom line:  not a bad place for a super special date night or to hob knob with DC's elite.  Could have sworn I saw a Supreme Court Justice dining there.  We should have come before our 7:30 seating for a better view of the Potomac.  Overall quality of the food was disappointing for the price.",3,2,0,0
"Michael H.","3/30/2014","Chapel Hill, NC","My wife said it best: We have been fortunate to dine at many great restaurants across the country, Fiola Mare was a cut above.  Everything was perfect.  Services was impeccable, three different people helped serve us and each was excellent.  We are already looking forward to returning.",5,0,0,0
"Anne P.","3/31/2014","Washington, DC","I would give this restaurant zero stars if possible. The owner was quite rude. I came with my daughter for a table for 2 at 7:30pm and despite the empty tables and the dining area being only half full, was told that there were no reservations until 9:30pm. I went on OpenTable and promptly made a reservation for 8pm (and there were tables available for 8:15, 8:45, 9, etc.). When I went back and told them that, quite clearly, they had reservations available, I was given no good explanation and was completely brushed off, nor seated, even though I now had a reservation. A restaurant that refuses to honor its reservations or seat walk-ins will not be in business long. I am a lawyer in town and I will never bring clients, colleagues, or friends to a place with such horrible customer service. There are plenty of other places to take our expense account.",1,17,7,3
"Jason T.","4/1/2014","Washington, DC","We did brunch here on a recent rainy Saturday and really enjoyed the food. We sat on the enclosed sundeck, which affords sweeping views of the Potomac and had some delicious food. The Brut Rose is $4 cheaper during brunch than during dinner -- and was quite tasty. It was a perfect compliment to the rich food served. We had the brunch special -- which included ricotta pear honey toast with shrimp and grits. Both were excellent and really tasty. We also had the incredibly tasty lobster ravioli (where you get three raviolis stuffed with claw and tail meat, plus on the side you get the other claw and a half tail - making it a whole lobster). We finished off the meal with a Tahitian vanilla cake that was served warm and was equally tasty. Overall, a great meal and we'll be sure to return.",4,3,0,0
"A K.","4/6/2014","Chicago, IL","Perfection from start to finish! I had an incredible lunch here with my Mother and can't wait to go back for dinner. I live a block away from Washington Harbor and never eat there due to the crowds. Fiola Mare has a completely different vibe than the rest of the waterfront. The restaurant is beautiful, with understated nautical decor and lots of marble. Service is absolutely impeccable. Every course was delicious, but the lobster ravioli is among the best I've had anywhere. I'm thrilled Fabio Trabocchi finally has a restaurant in Georgetown and I'm looking forward to being a frequent guest. Very highly recommended!",5,4,0,1
"Craig H.","4/13/2014","Washington, DC","If your roots go back far enough in Dc to the 50's and before, the best places to eat were along the southwest waterfront.  That neighborhood of course went downhill until just recently and the few remaining places cater to the tourist crowd.  Finally, fine dining returns with a view.Fiola Mare shares many of the characteristics with its parent restaurant.  The flavors are amazingly deep and rich.  The ingredients are fresh and expertly combined to produce beautiful meals.  The decor is warm and inviting inside with the river and the rising lights of Arlington in the backdrop.  We had a tuna carppacio which was amazing. My olive oil poached cod was the biggest, whitest, flakiest, and best prepared cod I've had and the flavors of my wife's gnocchi with halibut can't be described.The service was very good though to be in the league Fiola Mare is aiming for they need to ramp things up just a notch.  After enjoying a piece of bread, waiters assistant #1 comes by and asks if we would like more bread.  We say no and he picks up the bread plates and butter.  A couple minutes later waiters assistant #2 comes by and gives us new bread plates, bread, and butter.  There were a few other such minor mix ups.  Not enough to mess up the dinner but enough to say they need to keep training the staff.  We also waited probably 20 minutes for our car even though the valet was not busy.  Okay on a beautiful spring night but...This could easily be our new DC favorite.",5,0,0,0

"Maria-Elena T.","4/20/2014","Arlington, VA","Fiola mareFour of us dined on a Saturday night.  We were seated about 3 tables from the window and had no view. Actually it seemed that the ratio of tables that actually have a view would be low. We started at 8pm and ended our dinner 4 hours later. We did not order all 4 courses at once but purposely ordered each course when we were finished the previous one so as not to be rushed. I had the dirty martini and they made blue cheese stuffed olives for me. For an appetizer, I got the sardines grilled off the market section of the menu. Amazing! Light. Fresh. I would get them again. One person got the burrata cheese which he thought was not as described in the menu. The cheese itself was delicious, maybe even the best I've ever tasted. And the portion was a large size. Another person got the crab salad which was good and picture perfect.  For our next course we all did pastas. I ordered the half order of the clams and spaghetti. I was highly disappointed. It said it was like the Amalfi Coast.  I ordered this dish on the Amalfi Coast and do not recall it having tomatoes. The menu did not mention that it came with tomatoes. It was ok but the tomatoes bring a whole different flavor. The other three got different pastas. As the Yelp! reviews indicate, the lobster ravioli was the best dish during the pasta course.I planned to have the Branzino for my main course but I still did not feel pasta satisfied. Since there were 5 pastas on the menu, and we had ordered four of them, one was still left to order. I ordered it- the tagliatelli with prawns and sea urchin. This dish was absolutely delicious. I loved it. I ordered a half order but it seems the kitchen made it bigger. Jennifer helped us with our wine selections from my order by the glass to the bottle we ordered. Her knowledge of the Italian wine regions and grapes was impressive. She also said expect the wine selection to triple in the next 2 months. For dessert I got the lemon tart. It was cool looking with gold leaf on top and served with coconut ice cream. One person got the pistachio ice cream. It was so good she ordered another scoop. This is a must order! Our waiter was good; he obviously was not used to people ordering a course at a time. The bill was pure sticker shock. We all checked it, more than once. Unfortunately it was correct - it was over $700. Also we had a star siting - TV personality Kristen Welker was dining 2 tables away.",4,0,0,0
"Sarah K.","4/23/2014","Silver Spring, MD","I ate at Fiola Mare with 5 of my coworkers today and I was truly impressed. We got there at noon and the restaurant wasn't too busy which was nice since we got seated at a table with a great view of the water. All the staff was very nice and friendly, especially our server (Adam). The food was delicious and they have us all complimentary dessert! It's a little pricey but I don't mind paying more for great food and atmosphere. I had tuna tartare, gazpacho (which came with a plate of assorted breads), and the scallops. It was all really good but the scallops were my favorite. The dessert was also really good...it had olive oil cake and ice cream in it but I don't know the name since it was comped. I'll definitely be returning here in the future. P.S.- The faucets in the bathroom have a built in hand dryer...if that's not the coolest thing ever I don't know what is.",5,0,0,0
"Erica Y.","4/26/2014","Rockville, MD","How can you not give this place a five star? The lobster ravioli alone deserve 5 stars!  We came here for brunch but glad we tried their pastas instead of the normal brunch fare.  Their normal prefixe brunch is now $34 (was $28) which comes with one mimosa, an appetizer (usually some sort of bruschetta), an entree (shrimp and grits) and any dessert. It's a good deal but seafood and pasta is what makes this place awesome so you gotta have pasta here!  There are four pastas on the brunch menu and between the two of us we tried three.  We got half portions of Sardinian cavatelli, tagliatelle and lobster ravioli. Basically for half portion they charge you half the price of full portion plus $3.  Sardinian cavatelli is surprisly flavorful for a vegetarian pasta, tagliatelle the sauce is to die for with the sea urchins mixed in.  However the big prawn on top is undercooked (on purpose) and I'm not big on shrimp undercooked as it tasted too fishy for me. But I would eat the pasta part again no question!  I don't know what else to say about lobster ravioli that hasn't been said already...just order it, savor it, and immediately looking forward to the next time you can eat it.  It's amazing and pure joy to taste!Restaurant is beautiful and amazing view.  Service is good, and one waiter (not sure if he's one of the waiter or a supervisor or manager, he's got an accent, British maybe?) is just beyond great.  He went above and beyond to make the experience memorable for us.  I sure hope we get him next time too.Seriously, already planning my next meal there!",5,0,0,0
"Meredith D.","4/29/2014","Alexandria, VA","My boyfriend and I dined here last night to celebrate my birthday. We had 8 pm reservations and had planned to walk along the waterfront in (hopefully) nice spring weather, but rain made us rethink our plan. We showed up at the hostess stand at 6:30 and were swiftly seated, even though we were an hour and a half early! Our table wasn't directly next to the window, but did have a nice view of the river. The decor is sleek, elegant, and timeless. We were seated near shelves scattered with charming black and white photos of the chef's family and the Italian Marche coastline of his boyhood.We ordered two cocktails to start--his standard Beefeater martini, and the delicious Sapore Vero--Redemption Rye with Carpano Bianco Vermouth, Amaro Montenegro, and Luxardo Maraschino (basically a more complex Manhattan); it was fantastic. We had the interesting Sicilian Occhipinti Bianco ""SP68"" with our meal. It was bright, light, and refreshing, with distinctly floral notes that really went well with our delicate seafood dishes. We had the Hamachi Sashimi as a starter. Divine! It was served with wild ginger, lime and radish, and sprinkling of pansies. Without asking, they had divided and (beautifully) plated it on two dishes, which was perfect as we were sharing. This may have been my very favorite dish of the evening, as its simple preparation allowed the fresh flavor of the fish to totally shine.Next we shared two half orders of pasta--the famed Maine lobster ravioli, and the smoked potato gnocchi with diver scallops, ramps, charred spring onions, parsley and lemon. The lobster ravioli is a generous serving of lobster claw and tail meat over two delicate ravioli stuffed with even more lobster in ginger butter. It is (as many other reviewers have commented) exceptional, but incredibly rich. Each of us had one plump ravioli and several more bites of lobster, and it was perfectly done. But for me, that was more than enough. We wondered aloud if anyone actually ordered a full order and finished it--it was just too rich to want more than a few bites. The gnocchi was surprisingly complex, with the sweetness of the ramps offering added complexity to the dish. The two large scallops were perfectly prepared. I preferred this to the ravioli.My boyfriend ordered the Wild Turbot with olive oil crushed smoked potato, charred spring onions and Bolgheri Olive Oil. My Dover Sole was filleted table-side (a seemingly lost art, but a nice touch). It was served with grilled lemon, black olive salt, salsa verde, and fennel aioli. I ended up preferring it with a simple drizzle of the grilled lemon (which was a decidedly different taste from regular lemon), and swiped some of the charred spring onion from the other dish to accompany my own. We shared a side of blistered Shishito peppers, but I think the sauteed spinach with Meyer lemon would probably have been a better complement to the Sole.Because our server knew it was my birthday, she brought out a complimentary chocolate dessert sprinkled with gold leaf and topped with a candle, along with a card signed by chef Trabocchi thanking me for spending my birthday with them. It was a lovely touch! I don't think this particular dessert was on the menu, but it was a wonderful--three layers of chocolate. This was before even seeing the dessert menu!The desserts were incredibly tempting, and the restaurant's general manager stopped by to ask if we had any questions. I asked for his recommendations, as I was torn between two--and he subsequently suggested the very two I had been considering! I settled on the Spumone alle Fragole, but when our server returned, she delivered both it AND the Torta al Limone, saying that because I'd been torn they wanted to allow me to try both on my birthday. Again, a really nice gesture. Pastry chef Tom Wellings's creations are definitely an important part of the overall dining experience here. The Spumone ended up being my favorite, with incredible strawberry gelato mixed with chunks of Tuscan olive oil cake and topped with also exceptional, with tart lemon curd over shortbread and topped with tiny merengues, candied zest and gold flakes, served alongside a coconut sorbet. My boyfriend ordered the Cragganmore 12 year, and they brought out yet another plate with two chocolate macarons and two almond cookies as we finished up the meal. I couldn't even claim that I have that much of a sweet tooth, but I definitely think any diner here is doing themselves a disservice if they don't try at least one dessert!Chef Trabocchi was visible in the kitchen all evening, and the service was really top-notch. I didn't notice any of the hiccups that earlier reviewers noted with service. Our server, Johanna, was knowledgeable and attentive, with a great blend of friendliness and professionalism. It's a pricey dining experience, but well worth it for a special occasion.",5,2,0,0
"Robert G.","4/29/2014","Washington, DC","Fiola Mare has only been open a few months - and we've already been 4 times.  Their seafood is excellently prepared.  As with Fiola, don't miss a chance to have their lobster ravioli.  It is to die for.  I've also enjoyed their turbot, branzino, and sole.  If you select any of the 'market counter' items, they will present the fish to you and then filet it table side.  Nice touch.  The food here is incredible - all the way to the end of the meal with the complimentary chocolate macaroons and almond cookies.  Maria and Fabio Trabocchi have done a tremendous job with both the decor of this restaurant, and of course, its food!  Welcome to the Georgetown neighborhood...we hope you stay for the long term!",5,0,0,0

"Steven K.","5/7/2014","Minneapolis, MN","Food = 5, Decor/ambiance = 5, Service = 2Despite being a Sunday night, Fiola Mare was very busy. Many walk-in parties had to wait. I was glad to have a reservation. The ambiance is gorgeous with a great view of the Potomac. The décor is beautiful, and my food was delicious. My server had attitude; he was VERY busy. A table for one - maybe he thought it was okay to ignore me. I asked for a black napkin. None was forthcoming. I had to flag him down to order a glass of wine. But the worst faux pas, I was still savoring my starter - a heavenly burrata - when my entrée arrived. ""I'm not ready for it,"" I pointed out, and sent it back. Later my server came by. He did apologize, but came up with a lame excuse for the miscue. Sorry, that didn't cut it for me.",3,1,1,1
"Sylvie S.","5/8/2014","Washington, DC","Fiola Mare is the latest installation by Fabio Trabocchi of the original Fiola and more casual Casa Luca.  Having been to Fiola, and being quite impressed, I was interested to check out Fiola Mare.  Located on the waterfront by the corner closest to the arcing water fountain (not the main waterfront fountain), it was a little difficult to locate.  Some walking was required as we circled the building looking for the entrance but who can really complain when the weather is super.  The restaurant, like Fiola, is beautiful inside and really is a statement restaurant.  It is perfect for a special date or to bring out-of-towners after carousing the waterfront or shopping G-town.  To start, we shared the hamachi sashimi appetizer.  What a cool dish!  The fish was fresh and delish and the sides and flavorings were all very well paired.  The lime was refreshing and the little cubes of what I think was pickled ginger and thinly sliced radishes made for a very interesting dish!For my entree, I decided to take the servers recommendation and try the cod.  I definitely eyeballed the lobster ravioli but decided to go with the lighter option since many said the ravioli, although awesomesauce, is on the heavy side.  The cod was perfectly cooked.  Nothing worse than overcooked rubber fish and this cod was flakey and springy with oysters and caviar and little tempura fried things.  Although not as avant garde as the appetizer we tried, it was a very well executed dish.  I take away half a star only because I cringe a little when Italian food is so expensive... I mean, pasta for $30+?  It's pasta!  Sadly, in the states if you want quality Italian food you have to pay the price for it.  Since Fiola Mare is a seafood based restaurant, I suppose you are paying for the fresh cuts of fish/catches and that really does make a huge difference in the dishes.  Overall though, in the flagship DC dining scene, the prices are par for course.  Side note to event planners or whoever needs private dining space:  They have an abundance of private rooms.",4,3,1,0
"Vishal M.","5/11/2014","Washington, DC","My wife and I have not had the pleasure of enjoying what appears to be a fine menu here due to the rudeness and ineptitude of the staff at the front of the house. On one occasion, we walked in and two individuals barely greeted us, stared at each other awkwardly when we asked for a menu, and genuinely seemed like they had no idea what they were doing or how to handle guests at a restaurant. We left. On another occasion, I called to inquire about a 5:30 pm reservation for outdoor seating. The man on the phone, sounding unpolished and unprofessional, mumbled that they didn't have any tables, although Open Table clearly indicated otherwise. Some of this can likely be attributable to early growing pains, but I expect much more. Management should take a close look at the staff and put together a quality team befitting the restaurant.",1,2,0,0
"Elizabeth F.","5/12/2014","Washington, DC","Fiola Mare is the best restaurant experience I have had in D.C. and quite possibly the best meal I've ever had. The decor is beautiful, the service is phenomenal and the food is delicious. It's an upscale menu, perfect for special occasions, and worth the money for the quality of service, food and ambience you receive at Fiola Mare.Our table of three shared the Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella, Hamachi Sashimi, and Pan Fried Florida Frog Legs to start and they were all delicious! We had a great bottle of white and red wine, recommended by our fabulous waitress.For the main course, I had the Gragnano Spaghetti (the sauce on the pasta was so delicious- I was tempted to eat it like soup with a spoon), my sister had the Pan Seared Viking Village Scallops (the best scallops I've ever tasted), and our father ordered the simply grilled Spanish Branzino (a fresh, delicious whole fish carved right at the table). To end the meal, our waitress brought us an amazing chocolate ganache torte to share for dessert.I will definitely be returning to Fiola Mare and am eager to try their brunch menu.

"Norah C.","5/14/2014","San Francisco, CA","OH. MY. GOD.This place is where my food dreams become reality. Came here last Saturday for dinner with my roommate and her mother to celebrate Mother's Day a little early. We did not have a reservation but the hostesses were very gracious and seated us right away outside with a view overlooking the waterfront. A+ for location. NOTE: We came around 6 PM. Very early.This place is best described as Fancy (with a capital F) Italian seafood fusion. The chef is very creative because each dish is a combination of such exquisite flavors and AMAZING presentation. Our waiter was VERY attentive- A+ for service.This isn't your average restaurant- be warned, this place is VERY pricey. But I consider myself a foodie, and I would be willing to pay the hefty sum for dinner again. The three of us split two appetizers (each priced around $24). We also ordered a delicious bottle of wine.The waiter sold us on the monkfish liver.... I know what you're thinking... I am not a fan of liver but the way this dish tasted and was presented made me a believer. The dish was presented with flower garnishes and was seasoned with passion fruit seeds, strawberries, and salmon fish eggs (these are my favorite). The combination of flavors burst in my mouth - it was absolutely amazing.We also ordered the tuna carpaccio, which was served with a labna and finely chopped cucumbers (think tzatziki) and olives filled with capers. The fish melted in my mouth and the combination of flavors were sublime.We each ordered a pasta dish ($30-$39): lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and prawn bucatini with sea urchin. Each dish was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. A+ for taste, A+ for presentation.We splurged and got the bomboloni for dessert ($13)- they are doughnut holes made with ricotta and covered with sugar, served with hazelnut chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream. A little overindulgent but a must try.As you can tell, I am gushing over this place.. and making myself really hungry while writing this review. I ate there on Saturday and can still recite everything I had a couple days later. I would definitely come back.. probably for a special occasion.",5,0,0,0

"Virna V.","5/15/2014","Washington, DC","Beautiful restaurant with a great view of the water and it's the perfect spot to people watch. On the other hand, food and service was lacking from my experience. A few girlfriends and I came for lunch a few weekends ago and was seated outside. The server took a while to come and greet us which could have been forgiven at first occurrence but it happened the entire time. My friend ordered an appetizer and had barely finished speaking before the server turned around and left without asking anyone else what we wanted. It didn't seem very busy to me as it was during early dinner hours and we were all baffled as to why our server rarely came to our table. The seafood were all fresh in my opinion although most dishes we ordered were a little disappointing. The batter on the calamari appetizer was a little soggy and falling apart. One friend and I each ordered the squid ink risotto and we both couldn't finish it as we found it extremely salty. We grew up eating seafood in a tropical country therefore, we are very familiar with squid dishes. Two other friends each ordered the clam spaghetti which they both said was even saltier than the squid risotto, after having a taste of both dishes. They did however finish most their spaghetti. The highlight of the meal was the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio which we all agreed was simply delicious, there was not a crumb left on the plate.Considering the ambiance, location and prices I was definitely expecting better service and better food. I wouldn't mind coming back for a special occasion but will try new dishes.",3,1,0,0

"c c.","6/9/2014","Seattle, WA","I was really excited to try this place, esp since we had a great experience at the original Fiola and because of the rave reviews here on Yelp.  I have been looking for a good seafood restaurant in DC, as I miss all of the amazing seafood that I took for granted while living on the west coast.  I have to say that this entire experience was disappointing and a let down. The restaurant is beautiful, no doubt about it.  Unfortunately, the caliber of the food and service did not match the decor.  For starters, we were led to our table by a sassy bossy host with an attitude... not a good way to set the toneWe were seated at a window overlooking the Potomac, but our view was primarily of hoards of tourists lining up to get on and off the boats.  We went for brunch, and we tried:-Hamachi sashimi:  portions very small. It had a fresh presentation, but it wasn't memorable-Shrimp and grits: I love shellfish and seafood.  But this dish had an overpowering flavor profile (sausage maybe?) and the actual shells from the shrimp.  It reminded me a lot of a shrimp and grits dish at Vidalia yrs ago.  Only to find out later that the head chef at Mare happens to be from Vidalia.  -Bucatini with shrimp and uni:   pasta prepared well, and the uni made for a nice rich sauce.  This dish was probably the redeeming grace of our meal at Fiola Mare-Panna cotta:  We ordered this based on our server's recommendation.  It was good, but again -- not too memorable. Our server seemed a bit robotic and detached.  He tried to make an effort to engage with us, but he just didn't exude a natural warmth about him which made the whole experience awkward.  With an unfavorable staff, over-rated food, and a location that is very touristy, the atmosphere here is strange and uninviting.  Darn, I really wanted to like this place.",3,6,0,0

"Gumercindo A.","6/17/2014","Gaithersburg, MD","My fiancée and I decided to hit this gem by the water on a Monday evening - perfect day of the week to check it out rather than fighting for a 9pm reservation on a weekend night.We arrived at 7pm and surprisingly, the inside dining room was packed!  We sat in the outdoor patio overlooking the patio.  It was actually perfect.  First impressions - waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and what to recommend.  He started off my offering their special cocktail - a frozen negroni.  He sold me after he explained it and it was super yummy, perfect for a hot summer night.  Second first impressions - the prices are indeed steep.  I expected this beforehand after reading the yelp reviews.  We ended up getting the Lobster Ravioli and the Cod.  I am always hesitant to order pasta dishes, especially those of the $40 variety.  But, the yelp reviews touted the ravioli and the waiter emphasized that this was Chef Fabio's signature dish...when in Rome!  The cod was fantastic.  A really fresh fish that just melted in my mouth.  It came with a nice clarified butter/leak sauce.  The ravioli, on the other hand, had 3-4 pieces of ravioli but, the pasta was homemade, and the stuffing was crab/lobster and the lobster pieces that came with ravioli were large, fresh and had great texture.  The portions were a bit on the small side, but again, I kind of expected it.All in all I was pleased.  I wasn't blown away yet I think because the portions/ravioli didn't quite live up to the price.  Will definitely try again for the indoor ambience and the bar!",4,1,0,0
"Anna B.","6/21/2014","Washington, DC","The food was good, great even. We got oysters as an appetizer followed by two $30 pastas. I got spaghetti with clams and my fiancee ordered risotto. The seafood was very fresh and both dishes well put together. Wines while expensive by the glass ($18 no less) came in huge glasses and were probably 1.5 wine glass. The cocktails were very good. The reason why I wasn't truly impressed is because the service was horrible. When we arrived at the restaurant they were completely booked for the night, though literally half the restaurant was empty. Fortunately, we had a reservation but between them taking us to different tables all of which were certainly a terrible choice compared to some that were available (but apparently reserved and never taken) we spent 30 minutes waiting for the hostess to sit us. Two different hostesses forgot about us twice. The ambiance is interesting, the place is full of older men scouting for younger women and older fabulous DC housewives that are social lights walking back and forth with their friends to see the chef, wave at him and call him over to their table. Will I go back? We paid about $100 each which was a hefty price for the food/service we got. I can think of a couple of places here in DC where I'd spend that much on food before coming here. Though I have not seen a seafood place in DC that is as good/fresh as this. Maybe once the hype dies down and they simmer down with showing off I'll be coming back.",3,2,1,0
"Scott E.","6/21/2014","Bethesda, MD","Meh. One and done. Went last night to see what the fuss was. Nothing to get excited about. Not coming back. Food is good, not wow and price adjusted it's definitely not worth it. Physically it's very pretty. Nice views of the water for many seats (maybe half). Very good staff. Food comes quickly. Almost too quick.  Done in about 45 minutes and had to stretch it out over dessert a bit. Food was good but not great. Seafood was fresh. But it came out like any fresh seafood would taste. Not really much better than I can do at home if I hit the fresh seafood market first. My scallops taste exactly the same as the ones we had here. The salad - colors of the garden - was the best part of the meal. Nice mixture of unusual greens and a unique dressing. We split the dish and it turned out to be plenty. No reason to spend $18 each for a salad. Which by the way was an insane price but we knew that coming in. Wife had Under The Sea. Good sized portion of mixed seafood. Well cooked but no real seasoning or treatment for the seafood, until...  Until they pour over the salty porky tasting broth that ruined the dish. I suppose if you are cattle and appreciate a good salt lick this is for you. As for people reserve the broth to the side until you make up your own mind. I had Lobster Ravioli. Good. Not wow. Raviolis seemed a bit more wonton like in shape (bag like) rather than a traditional Italian flatter style. Stuffed ok per ravioli. Downside?  You get 3. That's it. 3 for $40. One claw and half a tail in the sauce. Sauce was good but nothing you can't get for elsewhere. Not to die for.Bellini was not as good as the one you can get at Brios. Dessert doughnuts weren't superior to your better churros!Spent much of the meal reminiscing about our last great meal at Inn at Little Washington. Then grabbed a cheeseburger on the way home to make up for the relative lack of food. Doesn't that just say it all!PS valet parking is only $15 so not too bad depending on how you tip. Reasonably open for a Friday night. You definitely could walk in and get a non view table.  Not hard to get into like Le Diplomat which is next on the list.",2,0,1,0
"Katherine H.","6/24/2014","Oklahoma City, OK","If I could afford to come here more, I would.I'm not sure why I left feeling like it was overpriced.1) Service: uh.maze.ing Some friends and i had a lil brunch here and they seated all of us (at the time of rezzie 10) in a back room with a great view of the water and had several waiters that seemed like they were only there for us (they weren't, but they were so attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive, it just felt like that, until I saw them serving another table nearby). When 2 folks didn't show up, they graciously removed the places without protest or attitude. They walked through the menu with us, made some great recommendations, and didn't push or pedal dishes people didn't want. Oh and at the end, they were like ""we knew this was to celebrate something but we didn't know what, so we brought this to you"" with a chocolate mousse and a candle. It was...well, sumptuous.2) Food: um. awesome. All said and done, folks had:     --bread basket: um. insane. homemade pastries, breads, etc. Several of my Euro friends said it was the best bread they've had in the states. I shouldn't eat it so I only tried a bite of 2 types and they were phenomenal. At 18 bucks though, it better be. That still seems steep...even though I know how they're all made and you'd have to pay me a lot more to do the work it takes to make those for you...     --grilled fish: Some friends had the arctic char and snapper; all perfectly seasoned, incredibly luscious. They didn't eat the skin so I did--it's the best part! The skin was perfectly fried--so crispy and amazing and rich in nutrition. I basically felt my hair, skin, and nails getting stronger, glossier, and more fabulous with each crunchy taste.     --""shrimp n grits"": soft polenta and 3 giant prawns. I and another friend had these. Wowzahs. This is the fanciest shrimp n grits this southern gal has ever tasted. While rich and decadent, this dish didn't leave us feeling overly stuffed, delightful.     --Bistecca y uova: steak and a giant duck egg, perfectly poached in olive oil. I tasted my friend's and wanted to swan dive into the parmigiano crema which is laced with hearty mushrooms.      --Cavatelli: So good my friend wouldn't let the rest of us taste it. I'm not kidding...     --Ahi Tuna Carpaccio: One of the prettiest presentations I've ever been served. It was beautiful, it was tasty. We all loved it--even the people weirded out by raw food.     --Crabcake: Again, bein gluten-free, I didn't really taste it, but it was a huge portion and folks were raving about it.     --Generally i skip dessert but you'd be stupid to not get some of the gelatos/sorbets. We tried the pistachio and chocolate gelatos. These were not your typical. They were stunning. The sorbets were coconut and passionfruit. Wow, so much flavor. 3) Drinks: Ok, these are ridiculously priced. They're also ridiculously good. I wanted more. I didn't because I was already breaking my bank account. We tried many of the mixed drinks, every single one of them was well balanced, flavorful, and beautifully presented.If you're like me, you won't be goin here often.

"Rachel H.","7/8/2014","Arlington, VA","This restaurant was beautiful, inside and out!  My boyfriend and I were in Georgetown Sunday afternoon over 4th of July weekend, looking for a place to eat on the waterfront.  We had our dog with us, and many of the restaurants on the water do not allow dogs any longer due to their new insurance policies.  We thought we were out of luck for waterfront dining, when we came upon Fiola Mare.  It was a little pricier than we were planning, but since we had the dog, we didn't have many choices.  This was a blessing in disguise since it gave us the opportunity to try this hospitable & delicious Georgetown treat!  First of all, the staff were so friendly and not uptight at all about accommodating our little four pound yorkipoo.  They searched high and low for  a water dish for her.  The staff was so friendly, someone even escorted us to the bathroom inside when we asked where the restrooms were!  We were there around 3:00, between lunch & dinner, so they were serving a somewhat limited menu, but we still found plenty to try.  My boyfriend asked that they make sure to not provide small, flabby oysters when he ordered the oysters on the half shell (we have had some bad experiences in the area with restaurants serving the teeniest of oysters), so the gentleman who brought them out made sure to explain that they did their best in selecting the largest, plumpest oysters for us, which we appreciated.  I'm not a fan of oysters, but I wanted to try one after the gent explained the sauces they served with them, and it was really good!  We ordered the fried calamari, which was unique in that it was long, wide strips of squid, not the small, rings you usually get.  They were really tasty & so was the aioli served alongside for dipping.  We also got the lobster roll, which had the perfect amount of slightly spicy mayo coating plump chunks of lobster meat, on the lightly toasted buttered roll - perfection!  We added some of the lettuces from the small salad provided alongside, which added a nice little crunch.  We got the three cheese plate and all of the cheeses were so flavorful and interesting.  The honey & cherries they served with the cheese were the perfect accompaniment.  Amazing food, very friendly/eager to please/happy service, and lovely location made for a great, five star dining experience.  I can't wait to go back (without the dog!) to try the full dinner menu.",5,0,0,0

This has never happened before to me when I had to explain my purpose of going inside a resturant.Another day, when I tried to inside this restaurant with a different friend, the guard stopped us again, by telling us there is a private party inside and we couldn't enter the restaurant. If the restaurant is such big and has a huge bar, why 2 people cannot go inside the bar. And I could see empty seats in the bar. But, the guard didn't allow us to go inside. I and my friend were pissed off and went to the other restaurant at the harbor called Nick's Riverside Grill where we received great customer service and no one questioned/asked us our purpose to go inside the restaurant.I and my friends can never imagine going to Fiola Mare again after receiving such bias and rude treatment by the guard and bad customer service by this restaurant. Glad there are other good restaurants around that don't treat customers this bias and rude based on their race.",1,5,1,1
"Greta N.","7/13/2014","Leesburg, VA","My husband and I came here 2 weeks ago to celebrate my birthday. It was our first visit. My husband was coming from work, so I enjoyed a ""Spring Garden"" cocktail at the bar while waiting. It was a great drink and reminded me of a course I had at Minibar called ""spring thaw"".We are huge fans of Fabio Trabocchi. His attention to detail is evident when you enter one of his restaurants. At Fiola Mare, I first noticed the service staff uniforms, which I loved. Even the check presenters had hand-stitched leather. All of these details are nice, but don't really matter if the food isn't good. The food isn't good here, it's amazing!I was avoiding gluten temporarily for 2 weeks, and our server confidently directed me towards safe options. I started with the burrata, which was great. Unfortunately, it came out with a bread crisp of some sort on top which I couldn't have, but this was a the only off thing that happened during our visit. The dish was delicious, and my husband enjoyed the tuna carpaccio to start.For dinner, we split the lobster ravioli and the ""under the sea special"". The mixed seafood plate was delicious, but the star was the lobster ravioli, which our server said would remind us of Maestro. We were not disappointed. We were able to enjoy it with gluten-free pasta. For dessert, my husband had the bomboloni, (donuts), which he said were superb. I had the ""Marchesi"" chocolate terrine with mint and pistachio.I noticed there were edible flowers on several dishes, including my cocktail. Seems to be a thing here.Now that we've enjoyed both Fiola and Fiola Mare, we hope to try Casa Luca next.We really miss Maestro! We loved everything about it, but are glad he's returned to the DC area so we can experience his lobster ravioli again.",5,3,0,0
"Karen P.","7/14/2014","Saline, MI","First, I want to start by saying the food was amazing. Everything my husband and I had was wonderful.  However, the service at the bar was horrible.  The hostess recommended we sit at the bar b/c there was an hour wait. We were fine with it b/c we usually like to sit at the bar. We sat down and we were waited on right away, which was nice. But the attitude of our server was horrible.  We felt like we were not good enough to be sitting at the bar let alone in the restaurant.  Our entire meal we felt that way.  We looked around and eveyone else at the bar seemed to get better service. They all had a bowl of mixed nuts placed in front of them after they ordered a drink, we had to ask.   I'm not even sure if we were asked how our meal was.  We odered several drinks, an appetizer, two salads and two entrees... we spent a lot of money in this restaurant to be treated like we didn't belong.  Doubt we'll be going back, even if the food was wonderful, not worth the treatment for what we spent.",3,0,0,0

"Richard K.","7/16/2014","Encinitas, CA","A great place if you want to impress a date by spending a lot of money for very little food that doesn't match the description from the waitstaff.I was visiting the area and meeting a friend at the Waterfront.  When I pulled in there was valet parking that was $15 if you were going to Fiola Mare or $40 if you were not.  It looked good so I decided to valet park and try it out.My friend had the ""Giant Madagasgar Salt Prawn"" (notice the singular), and I had the ""Under The Sea"" which was described as a large plate with a large assortment of seafood on a bed of quinoa.  I specifically do not like a lot of sauce and didn't want a variation of a Cioppino.  What I received was a bowl with very little seafood (2 muscles, 1 small shimp, 1/2 a tiny langoustino, a very small square of fish, and a small square of foise gras) in a bowl to which the server started pouring a broth base.The food was tasty but insanely overpriced for the tiny amount of food that we received.  My friend, a very petite woman, commented that everything on the menu must have been appetizers.  This meal with 2 cocktails cost $152.90 not counting the gratuity.After having ""dinner"" we decided to go to another restaurant to have another drink and get some more food.  When we returned, the restaurant was closing and the valet was gone.  I asked the person in the restaurant where the keys to my car were and she told me that the valet left them with the person working in the parking garage.  When we went to the garage the person there did not have my keys.  I went back to the restaurant to find that everyone had left.  Walking around, I found the valet stand and decided to look through it and found my car keys in the only drawer in the stand where anyone could have easily retrieved them.Because I had paid the valet, I did not have a ticket for the parking garage.  When I tried to get out of the garage the attendant made me get another ticket as a ""Lost Ticket"" to which I had to pay another $20 just to get my car out.I can easily say that I have no intention of going to this restaurant ever again.  There are too many other places in the area with outdoor seating and views to need to put up with this kind of service again.",1,18,4,1

We were greeted by 2 fellows one of whom opened my (driver's) door, anticipated my jacket in the back seat and held it for me to adorn. From that point an absolutely sparkling young woman welcomed us inside and showed us to our table. Our waiter, whose name I will retrieve and add in an edit later, was superbly professional, friendy, knowkledgeable and confident and an intergral part of our exceptional experience.

"Dean N.","7/22/2014","Manhattan, NY","I'll start by saying I've never written a bad review for a restaurant on yelp, but the poor treatment at Fiola Mare compelled me to do so. It was absolutely atrocious. Their General Manager, John Gilbert, posed as the sommelier and recommended a few bad bottles of wine. He eventually handed the reins over to the actual sommelier after we sent a bottle back. That was embarrassing for us since nobody in our group had done that before. The other sommelier did a nice job.It wasn't until the end of the meal that we find out we had been charged for a $500 bottle of wine we didn't consumer let alone order. Gilbert was very rude and effectively told us we would be paying for it, ""I've made my decision."" We asked him to produce the $500 bottle and he could not. Several waiters and staff informed us of his terrible reputation around town.  This is where the story gets ridiculous. He brought their bouncers over to threaten us and escort us out after we paid. I've never been to a nice restaurant that required bouncers. It was very theatrical. Since that dinner, July 18th, we have spoken to the owner and contacted our credit card company to alert them of the fraudulent charges. We told John Gilbert we would not be tipping and that his waiter would suffer because of the way we were treated. He said ""we'll take care of our waiters."" He certainly doesn't care about his customers. In addition, I'd like to add I was on a father-son trip.  Myself and two of my close friends were just trying to enjoy a nice dinner with our fathers since we all rarely spend time together.If you value customer service and don't want a bouncer to force you to pay your bill, I would recommend going anywhere else.The food was ok, but very overpriced for what it was. I think the other reviews will support that statement.I would expect more terrible reviews to come with John Gilbert managing this restaurant.",1,17,2,1

"Allie G.","7/30/2014","Atlanta, GA","My boyfriend and I visited Fiola Mare on Saturday, 7/26, for a special, celebratory dinner.  We had checked reviews online and were sold immediately. We call and unfortunately we were told there were no available times and they weren't taking reservations that it was first come first serve. We decided to go anyway and take a chance - thinking we could pop over to Sequoia if things didn't work out. We arrived to a very helpful hostess, Madeline, who informed us that although they don't take reservations there were only a few people ahead of us and if we stayed close by we'd be seated within an hour. We were in no hurry so we went to the bar to check it out. The bartenders were wonderful and attentive. One saw me eyeing a seat that had recently become available, he placed a glass down and set out a menu, holding a spot until I could walk around the bar. The drinks were AMAZING! I highly recommend the Spring Garden and my boyfriend exclaimed they had a nice bourbon list. To our pleasant surprise we were seated within 20 minutes (not the hr originally told) and had the best seat in the house on the patio overlooking the Potomac. The manager, Daniel, stopped by our table and was incredibly personable. We noticed he was not only friendly with us but with all tables, going as far as speaking Spanish to the table close by to the vacationers. After our meal of oysters, tagliatelle, and burrata I was full and declined dessert. Daniel wound up sending over 2 servings of gelato anyway, vanilla and burnt honey, exclaiming, ""you HAVE to have dessert after an Italian meal"". Absolutely everything about our dinner at Fiola Mare was top notch - from the service to the food to the ambiance. We will definitely be back!",5,2,0,0
"Christopher C.","7/30/2014","Washington, DC","4.5 StarsWith the demise of Citronelle, Fiola Mare is hands down Georgetown's best restaurant right now, and definitely giving Cafe Milano a run for its money as the place to see and be seen.  It certainly has something that Milano lacks:  a waterfront view.  It's located in Washington Harbor complex; not in the submerged center like Fishers Farmers Bakers (no need to worry about flooding) but off to the side in the corner directly opposite Sequoia's.And they do make the most of the space.  There is outdoor seating overlooking the Potomac, and most of the indoor seating is oriented to give you a view of the water.  There are two bars (one can be closed off and used as a private event space) and an open kitchen with fresh seafood proudly displayed on ice.  Also on display the night I stopped by was chef/owner Fabio Trabocchi, who busy coordinating all of the dishes as they came out of the kitchen.But enough about the layout, the food was exquisite!  Things got off to a bit of a rocky start when I ordered the Fiola Negroni; I am not a fan.  It was like a slurpee and difficult to drink without a straw.  But from there things improved considerably.  We started our meal with the Frutti di Mari (seafood platter containing east and west coast oysters, mussels, clams, lobster, jumbo lump crab, ahi tuna tartare, head-on prawns, sea urchin, calamari salad, and jellyfish salad.  This was designed for two to three people and probably could have been a meal in itself.  It was very different from any plateau de fruits de mer I've ever had; in addition to the unusual assortment, it had a very Japanese/Asian influence to it (as did much of the other food) particularly the jellyfish salad with the noticeable flavor of sesame oil.  It would not have been out of place as an otsumami at a Japanese izakaya.For my main I had the incredibly rich bucatini with prawns, sea urchin, and espelette chilis (pastas comes in full or half portions).  I finished it all of with a marchisi chocolate terrine for desert.  The menu is actually fairly limited and changes frequently, but a constant is the large selection of fish that you can get simply grilled.  For non-seafood eaters, they have Japanese wagyu steak, but you pay by the ounce, with a three ounce minimum which, rest assured, does not come cheap.As you would imagine, they have an extensive wine list and since this is a seafood place there is an emphasis on whites.  Italian whites offer a better value than their red counterparts and Fiola Mare offers quite a few for under $50/bottle.  We settled on a bottle of Antonucci Castelli di Jesi Riserva Verdicchio from ""Fabio's White Collection"" which paired well with our seafood.We were seated promptly and service was excellent.  The only discordant note was after about 9pm when they dimmed the lights and the music (lounge/house) from the the bar was annoyingly audible in the main dining room.",4,6,0,1

"Steven b.","8/12/2014","Chevy Chase, MD","I had one of the most memorable meals of my life at Fiola Mare 2 days ago. The chef (Fabio Trabocche) has two other restaurants. I will definitely be trying them as well. The focus is on 'la Marche' italian food, which is a region on the northeast coast of Italy.It is rare for a restaurant to cover all bases (attention, food, interior) as efficiently as Fiola Mare did. When we told them we were here for an anniversary, they really showered us with attention, but not in a obtrusive way. The ratio of waitstaff to diners is also outstanding, and everyone shares chores.Their citrus lobster salad brought me back to one I had in France nearly 30 years ago (warm lobster and grapefruit), and the lobster ravioli with a San Marzano sauce was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  The grilled Branzino was superb: simply but perfectly cooked, with subtle seasoning, and expertly dissected at the table by the waiter. Wine list was excellent, and the wines were not overpriced, with a good mix of both moderate and expensive wines, as well as by the glass. This place is on a par with the two best places in Rome that I ate at last year. The number of five star restaurants that I know of that are as accessible and enjoyable to eat at as Fiola Mare are very few. I plan to take my friends here to share this again.",5,2,0,1
"Murlo R.","8/13/2014","Hartford, CT","Fiola Mare prepares interesting and at times exotic seafood with Italian inspirations.  The value at Fiola Mare is in the diner's access to seafood choices that are not usually available in the area, or even the country.  The prices tend to reflect this.  The preparations were creative, but did not necessarily meet expectations.  They were a little better on paper.  Other seasonal choices currently include a Maine Lobster dish at $60, which is a bit steep.  On the other hand, true Dover Sole sells for about $30 a pound in England, so $50 a pound prepared at a restaurant in Washington DC is not too outrageous.  Service was generally friendly and attentive.  The server's wine suggestion worked very well and was not driven by the ""upsell.""The atmosphere is light, elegant, and contemporary.  A curved white-stone bar in front is welcoming, though the stools anchored to the floor looked tidy, but were cumbersome - function took a backseat to form.  A narrow patio surrounds the restaurant with views of the Potomac not usually available at DC eateries.  The music was modern loungy, unobtrusive, and fitting, but did not carry outside.  In the end, dining at Fiola Mare is enjoyable.  But it did not meet the higher expectations that come with its unique offerings, inviting complimentary ingredients, and  commanding prices. This is why I could not assign 4 stars, but Fiola is better than 3.  Perhaps my next visit will tell.  (June/July 2104)",3,2,0,0

"K D.","8/24/2014","Mercer Island, WA","For all the wrong reasons I  had one of the most memorable meals in my life At Fiola Mare in mid July.  I would give it one star, but maybe it was a bad night.  The hostess, deep in conversation with other members of the staff, finally acknowledged us, sort of, and although we had a reservation and had asked to be seated outside,  she wanted to put us in the main room.  So we (3 women in our 60's) asked politely if there was any chance to be seated outside.  She escorted us to a table wedged in the corner of the screened in area, next to the wait prep area. This table should not even exist.  It is so jammed into the corner that it had to be pulled way out to just get one person into a chair.  It also turned out to be sweltering, there was no breeze in that tight space. Not their fault, but there were many tables free and stayed that way while we were there.Our waitress treated us like like she was ticked off that she had to serve us.  We were well dressed, friendly and were looking forward to dinner here.  The woman who was hosting us had been here (she lives next door at the Watergate) and was treating us to the supposedly exceptional meal.The wait to place our order was interminable. She did give us descriptions of the menu but we had to ask several questions.  I, for one, have had whole fish served to me, but never had I had it deboned ""at the table"".  Where I was seated I got to watch another waiter (not at ""the table"") hunkered over a fish, trying desperately to take the bones out , sweating and obviously taking too long to do it.  Don't know where that poor fish ended up.We had hors'd ouevres.  I'm sorry that I can't remember 2 of the dishes, but one of us had the lobster ravioli which was to die for.  (I guess that is what the second star is for). The flavor was mellow and light with chunks of lobster garnishing the ravioli.   The other dishes (and they were tiny) were so yesterday.  Nothing that seemed fresh and original.Next the entrees.  2 of us shared the sea bream.  By the time it was deboned it was cold and the portion was tiny, but the sauce was great.  However, not enough fish to share even though we were told it would be.  We also ordered skate and it was DOA.  It looked like it had been sitting under a heater for the last 30 minutes.  Again, sauce was good, but it was so old.  Maybe they waited to serve it until the fish was deboned.We ordered some side dishes...marginal.  Honestly, nothing special.  Spinach, mashed potatoes.  How can you not have something incredible?  Not even hot when it hit the table.Saving grace:  the chocolate lava cake.  We shared one.The valet parking was $15 off the bat.  Then we felt like we had to tip the valet guy.  OK, I made us tip him.  My son did that for 6 months during college, so...I don't know.  Seems like lots of people like this restaurant.  Myself?  I think the emperor has no clothes.",2,3,1,0

"Deb L.","8/25/2014","Washington, DC","This is a nice restaurant.  I went there for lunch with a former colleague who is a bit of a foodie and it was rather impressive.  It's a seafood restaurant with Italian flare!  I'm quite a casual eater in the sense that if I dined with the queen, I wouldn't make a fool of myself, but I certainly would use the wrong fork at some point in time.   Since I was going to lunch with my foodie friend, I wanted to pick somewhere I knew he would enjoy.  He is not the kind of guy to grab a burger so I heard good things about Fiola Mare and figured it would be fun to try it out.We arrived and were seated promptly.  The restaurant is light and airy and comfortable.  It was rather busy, but the noise level was great - you could have a proper conversation and everything.   We perused the menu and both decided on the Maria Menu - three courses for 28 dollars sounded like a great deal.  This place is not the destination for a cheap lunch, if that is what you are looking for.  The gazpacho was as good as I had in Spain - really refreshing and bursting with flavor.  The portion size was perfect too. The main was an artic char.  I had never had char before but it was really good!  It was served with some clams in a very delicious sauce.  I left a bite or two on the plate but only because I was so satisfied.   Our third course was a sgroppino which neither of us had had before.  Our server explained that it was a small amount of sorbet mixed with moscato.  It came served in this adorable little glass with a straw and was very interesting.  Easy to drink with a great balance of tartness and sweetness. Overall it was a very interesting and tasty lunch.  It's not something I would have ordered on my own, but I am glad I had the chance to try it.  Service was even and friendly throughout our meal and we never felt rushed.  It's not an inexpensive lunch, but I find the quality of the food and service to be much better than what you find at some of the other restaurants on the G-town waterfront.  This place offers a quality experience with friendly service.  I would definitely go again!",4,1,0,0

"Alice P.","9/22/2014","Washington, DC","It was a beautiful day and my friend and I headed to the waterfront for lunch. The setting of Fiola Mare is perfect -- and we chose to sit in settees under a canopy. Despite our somewhat remote location the waitstaff was extremely attentive. I ordered from the Maria Menu which is supposed to be somewhat fewer calories. It was delicious and no calorie reduction noticed in its preparation. $80 for two for lunch without wine? Yes, it's steep, but sometimes it's worth it.",5,0,0,0
"Derek H.","9/23/2014","Washington, DC","Celebrated a special occasion here over the weekend and, for the most part, was really happy.  Was able to get a table on the 'upper balcony' area outside, which is where I recommend anyone coming here try and be seated if the weather's up for it.  Great view of the key bridge, kennedy center, and river depending on which side of the table you're on.Seafood is definitely the way to go here; they have some of the freshest I've had in the city. The lighting on the balcony is a little dim, though, so it is hard for me to really tell how awesome the food looked -- but it all tasted amazing.  Entree-wise I inhaled the Taste of the Sea (basically this big bowl of different seafood - langoustine, branzino, scallop, foi gras, shrimp, and other stuff I can't even recall - on a bed of quinoa) and the lady had the much lauded lobster ravioli. She gushed; I was really happy. Much happier than when I dined at sister-restaurant Fiola.Close it all out with their take on bon bons, which come in an oak cigar-ish box tableside, and you're definitely going to head home happy.My biggest knock would be the service was spottier than you'd like at a place with this type of price tag. Took awhile to get a second round of drinks ordered, they forgot the olive oil with the bread, and some other minor hiccups. I think the manager realized it since we got a comped dessert out of nowhere, but keep this in mind when planning a night here.All in all, there's few -- if any -- places that par an awesome setting with exceptional food in DC. That makes Fiola Mare a really unique and welcome addition to a neighborhood that needs it.",4,5,1,2
"Lois D.","9/29/2014","Washington, DC","The setting on the river couldn't be better and the restaurant's decor  is very tasteful and welcoming.  The food, however, didn't measure up to the reviews (Tom Sietsema plugs it at  every chance,  perhaps he's recognized), nor did the food match the beautiful weather and the decor.The waiter/server was not  top-notch but we wouldn't have cared if the meal had been. The entrees and sides arrived in less than 10 minutes and immediately we knew we weren't being served  delicious, freshly prepared food.   The Bucatini, Brazino,  Gragnano  spaghetti chitarra and the sides  were not the proper temperature and the flavor would have been better at many other restaurants  in the Washington area. The Brazino was an unappealing piece  of fish on a plate, period. The pasta in the Bucatini could have come from a can.We were disappointed, but didn't complain.  When you follow  even the very good  reviews, you take your chances. We  decided we would let Tom and the First Couple  enjoy the restaurant.I love a lovely view and pretty décor while I dine, but I like delicious, properly prepared food better.",2,1,0,0
"Katerina B.","9/29/2014","Miami, FL","Seriously just had one of the most memorable nights dining out! Huge shootout to our waiter Kris and coffee master Yousef! First of all, completely disregard some of the other comments about the food being ""too small"" or ""snack size"". Unless you're someone who can eat for days, the portions at Fiola Mare were more than reasonable. We left the restaurant completely stuffed to the brim. We were a table of 3 and for starters we had the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio and the Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella. Both very different and exciting dishes but both exquisite! For our entrees, we each shared the Lobster Ravioli, Japanese Kagoshima Ribeye, and the Tagliatelle with Burgundy snails, mushrooms, and burgundy truffle. Both the tagliatelle and the kagoshima had shaved truffles - amazeballs!! Dessert was the vanilla & rum cake along with the tarta san marcos. Coffee was great too - nice and strong. I can't say that I disliked anything. No, it's not cheap - but since when is exceptional food cheap!? We were luckily able to sit outside with an amazing view of the Potomac on a gorgeous, clear, and cool (but not chilly) night in DC. Can't wait to come back on our next trip. Just perfect.",5,3,0,1

Every single piece of food I sampled from the buffet was delicious! Smoked salmon? Check! Ricotta donut holes? Check! Lobster rolls? Double check (because I ate so many of them!). And the drinks... downright amazing and I was happy to see that their selection went beyond the standard mimosa and bellini. The waitstaff was phenomenal!

It was still amazing smelled like heaven!! Though it's a 'mare' restaurant we were convinced that a good restaurant would have some meat. So we asked. The server let us know that the chef had some wagyu beef with foie gras. That's it! It was just fantastic!

"Lauren B.","11/2/2014","Montrose, Houston, TX","Delicious food, crisp service, beautiful view & excellent drinks. Though it is described as having a ""dressy"" dress code, it is more business finery than truly dressy attire so if you eat there before attending a black tie function you'll feel a bit overdressed.Order the lobster ravioli. It's nearly $50, but has two full claws & over one tail's worth of jumbo lobster meat. That is not counting the bits stuffed along with pureed potatoes (?) within the pasta. My husband ordered the ravioli,& I was jealous. The truffle/mushroom dish I ordered was good, but not as nuanced as his. We had a clam special that was outstanding. The balance of flavors & inclusion of flowers & yound pea shoots captured the essence of summer. Cocktails & wine were excellent, as was the service. If you are going for a special occassion, tell them! You'll receive complimentary champagne or dessert.

Then, I had half portion of the AGNOLOTTI OF MODENA COTECHINO SAUSAGE ($18) and my fiancé ordered the MADAI SNAPPER ""FISHERMAN STYLE"" ($44). The agnolotti were fantastic but the snapper wasn't. The filet was small and the shellfish that came with it was decorative but mostly inedible. The Arneis wine ($16 a glass) we drank during the meal was easily forgettable.

"Christine L.","11/14/2014","Washington, DC","I went to the highly coveted Fiola Mare, and I have mixed reviews. The food that I enjoyed most were what we got for free, which was a squash soup and lemon ginger ice cream. In the ice cream, the ginger was so subtle, but amazingly good with the lemon. My friend had the lobster ravioli and he said that it was just okay. I had the HAND-CUT TAGLIATELLE, which was very delightful, which a bold flavor. We shared the AHI TUNA CARPACCIO, which came together well, but not the most amazing carpaccio I have had. To finish off, my friend and I had the hazelnut souffle. It was amazing, especially with the dark chocolate drizzle! Why 3 stars? The service was amazing. Although I did not order wine, the waiter gave me a tasting to something they had open which was also good. The other tastings we got through the meal made the experience well worth it. In the end, we paid about $170 with tax and tip for the both of us. I probably won't come back for a while, as I feel  it is more expensive than I want to spend for a regular meal.",4,1,1,1

"David L.","11/18/2014","Brigantine, NJ","While Monday dinners at many restaurants are often hit or miss propositions, especially after coming off busy weekends, at Fiola Mare, even though it was Chef Fabio Trabocchi's day off, the restaurant did not skip a beat and was definitely on. Came here for dinner last night and was not disappointed.  Started off with dozen of fresh oysters - Kumamoto, Kusshi and Belon (off the menu).  Accidently were given Raspberry Point oysters which we didn't order.  The kitchen promptly made good on the mistake without batting an eye. No fuss, no embarrassment, seamlessly resolved to our delight.  So fresh, so clean (no sand or grit). Interesting and tasty citrus foam (one of the Fiola Mare accompaniments), but the oysters were delicious with just a touch of the vinegar. Next course was the Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella.  Big fan of burrata so had looked forward to this preparation that comes with a ""Romana style"" salad of baby artichokes, cucumber, pesto of Basil Genovese.  Came out split into two portions for sharing.  Intuitive.  Anton who was taking care of us must have overheard our conversation.  Nice to avoid the messy exercise of trying to put a portion onto a bread plate. Oh, and yes, it was delicious.  Pillowy soft.  Right balance of flavors, textures.  Perfect setup for next course.Hand-cut Tagliatellle with wild mushrooms, Porcini Crema, Prosciutto, Grilled Pork Belly, Cacio de Roma, Sunny-Side up Duck Egg.  Sounds like pasta alla carbonara, right?  But this is so much more.  The mushrooms and Porcini Crema give the sauce an unbelievably silky mouthfeel.  Perfectly cooked pasta and depth of the flavors took me directly to my comfort food zone. Grilled pork belly was tender.  I would order this again, no hesitation.Under the Sea is a seafood lovers delight.  Lobster, crab, prawn, calamari, Stone Bass, Langoustine, mussels, foie gras, quinoa, Parmesan dashi. As an unabashed broth dipper, I had to taste the dashi and found it rich with the flavors of sardines, which some may not like, but it added such depth and a taste of authenticity.  I mean, come on, how often can one identify the fish flavors in a broth?Dessert.  I'm skipping dessert, not because of any disappointment, but will likely write more after second visit.  The four little almond, apple pasty-type bites at the end were deliciously whimsical.Want to point out little things that are often taken for granted, but the attention to details on more than one occasion, gives a sense of what Chef/Owner Fabio Trabocchi has created here.Earlier stated that kitchen mistake was deftly handled.  Second thing, though small, merited notice.  When was the last time you ordered wine by the glass did they bring out the bottle and poured the wine at your table, versus just bringing you a pre-filled glass of what you presumably ordered?  The butternut squash soup as an amuse was nice surprise to start the meal. Great service always enhances the total dining experience and was clearly the case.Lastly, the layout of the restaurant is visually opportunistic.  What I mean is, while most diners crave the view of the Potomac river, and it is wonderful during the day, for foodies such as myself, getting a birds-eye view of the kitchen is as captivating for me as watching the river to others.I was tweeting during the meal (I know, bad manners), and to my delight, even though Chef Trabocchi was off, he kept replying.  That passion is what being the chef/owner of one of the hottest restaurants in DC is about, I guess.In the immortal words of Arnold....""I'll be back.""",5,0,0,0

"Ylonda C.","12/16/2014","Baltimore, MD","I would give it five stars, but the hostesses almost had me turning around to leave.  This is not the first time this has happened.  This time we visited for Sunday brunch. There were three young ladies at the door to greet and seat.  However, with three parties at the door, they looked a little confused and disorganized.  However, most importantly, not one of the ladies ever smiled, said hello, or welcomed me to Fiola Mare.  There was also a little confusion with the seating.  I know Fiola Mare tries to save the window seats for their VIPs, but the rush hadn't quite hit yet.  So, I was confused by where they sat us.  With a little discussion, we had that fixed.  Now for the good part!  Our server Anton was awesome!  He single handedly turned this visit around.  Anton was well versed in the menu and how every dish was prepared.  He was pleasant and excited about the food which made us excited about the food.  The bread basket had three or four different types of bread.  All were wonderful and delicious.  We all had the Lobster bisque which was pretty amazing.  Instead of pieces of lobster, there were fried lobster balls in the soup.  The broth was delicious as was the lobster.  Our entrees included the shrimp and grits, seafood pasta, and lobster roll.   Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the lobster roll, but it was beautifully plated.  The shrimp and grits were probably the best I ever had.  The seafood pasta was perfectly flavored, but the pasta was a bit under cooked for me.  I love al dente pasta, but it was a bit thick for me which may have caused the problem with it being undercooked.  With that said, I would still try the dish again because the seafood was tasty.  For dessert, we tried a few different things including, the panna cotta, gelato, and vanilla cake.  I'm not a panna cotta fan, but this panna cotta may have made me a panna cotta fan!  :)  The gelato was good, but not as exciting as the other desserts.  I would definitely recommend Fiola Mare to others and will definitely return to try dinner.",4,1,0,4

One member of our party ordered a glass of Cabernet while we waited and the bartender gave him the most expensive wine on the list without asking if that was ok.  Bartender Code Violation!I went to the restroom about 45 minutes into our wait for a table and they were out of paper towels.  That wouldn't have bothered me so much -- or at all -- if the first two things hadn't happened, but I was hungry, the big birthday celebration that I had planned wasn't coming together, and so I yelled ""Screw this place!"" and scared a man who was just walking in.  But enough about my anger management problems.  Let's move on to the good news.The woman at the front of the house was fantastic.  She seemed genuinely concerned that it was taking so long, and brought our party glasses of Prosecco.  About a half hour into the reservation delay, some staffers brought us salads to eat while we stood around waiting.  When we were finally seated, it was a great table with an incredible view.  Our waiter Stefan was amazing.  We didn't hide that fact that we were pissed off about the wait, and he managed to deftly turn the conversation and the mood in the right direction.  He was one of the best waiters I've run across in D.C. in years.  We ordered fish and lobster ravioli and salads and on and on and he kept the liquor and wine flowing and the mood lifted, the birthday was celebrated, and it turned into a great night.  The food was fantastic.  All of it.  I'd recommend this restaurant, and I look forward to going back...but maybe I'll bring an emergency bag of potato chips for the wait.",4,0,1,0

The wine list was extensive and had a great selection of Italian wines in addition to the French and domestic. Truly a decadent experience with fantastic service, the wait staff was wonderful! It was also a plus that they had a dedicated doorman as well as coat and bag check at the door.",5,0,0,0

Most discerning locals we spoke to said they consider this to be one of the top--if not the top--restaurant in DC. I can't overstate how outstanding all aspects of the meal were--service and cuisine. I read in some other Yelp reviews that there is some inconsistency at the front when people interact with the hostesses. I didn't have any problem at all.",5,0,0,0
"E. S.","1/2/2015","Atlanta, GA","This is definitely one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. We went to several fantastic restaurants in the area, but this was the best in every respect. Each course was perfected from taste to appearance, the ambience was relaxing with beautiful views of the river, and the service was exceptional. Our server, Milad, was so attentive to our every desire. He served well as a sommelier and made sure there was always something available for the entire table if someone had ordered a course that another had not. Samples and top offs were second nature as he ensured we had the best dining experience possible. I cannot speak highly enough about this establishment.",5,0,0,0

I don't really think DC has many good places to go to eat (besides Thai Xing and Graffiato) but seriously, every single thing we put in our mouths was beyond amazing. The bottomless brunch was 100% worth it and the drinks were 10x better than any mimosa or bloody mary you have had.

Our waiter Rick and his support waitstaff went above and beyond to treat my mother like a queen for brunch on her 60th birthday. The waiter and his support staff were attentive, witty, conversational, helpful and genuine. The food was absolutely amazing--who knew you could have so much decadence and presentation for a brunch! Highly recommend the Signature Brunch, it's worth the extra. And the complimentary cake with gold flakes and prosecco for her birthday...amazing!

"Brad R.","1/6/2015","Manhattan, NY","It may be that Fabio Trabacchi has begun to ""dial it in"" because the restaurant that I visited last night for dinner is definitely not the one that is being raved about by professional restaurant reviewers and every day bloggers. The space is beautiful and I can only imagine it on a beautiful May or June evening as opposed to the January pre snowy evening that we encountered on our visit. We ordered the cold shellfish platter which was neither abundant nor delicious. In fact, I would say that the platter was phenomenally underwhelming. The shrimp was far too overcooked, the lobster was mushy, the clams were unbelievably tiny, and the oyster selection was limited and not very good at all.  There are much better cold shellfish platters available in Washington DC, and probably even for less money and served with much better pairing sauces than the very strange and gloppy mayonnaise-based sauces that they served with the cold shellfish. Sometimes a little red cocktail sauce infused with horseradish and tabasco along with a straight up classic mignonette does the trick. The sauces did nothing to either hide the horrible quality of the seafood or to mask the mundane taste and consistency of the fish. Surprisingly, the burata salad is delicious and probably one of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, I did not come here to extol the virtues of a burata salad. I came here for fish that is made with as light a touch as Le Bernardin or Oceana in NYC.  The restaurant completely struck out. Even their much heralded pastas (we ordered all three of them plus the lobster ravioli) which read on the menu as the most novel and creative homemade pastas ever made, all had the exact same flavor profile with the exception of the lobster ravioli which was creative and quite good. Perhaps any one of the other three red sauce fish pastas that we ordered would've been great on its own, but when you order all three of them to share as a pasta course they became indistinguishable from each other and whatever unique flavor notes that each actually possesses were completely lost in combination. The  tuna carpaccio signature appetizer is good, infused with San Marzano tomatoes and some type of foam. The texture was all a little strange but the taste is quite good. Pass on the Arctic Char. Mine was truly tasteless and inedible. Langoustine looked ok but nobody at the table gave them a rave.   Best dish: the homemade doughnuts ala mode for dessert.Caveat Emptor!",2,2,1,0

The manager came over to the table and was extremely insulting and rude.  My father gave me an expensive present in box (inside a bag with tissue paper). I accidentally left the bag at the table and ran back inside after we left to see if the waiter had found it. After 10 minutes went by, the hostess comes back with my bag. I got home and took the card and box with my present out of the bag. The only problem was that the box with my present was empty!!

"Daniel T.","1/23/2015","Alexandria, VA","My date and I had dinner here on a weekday. Great location. Lively, but mature, bar scene. Service was among the best in the DC area. The restaurant is very loud. They have an open kitchen and fairly large bar area...you have to speak loudly for people at your table to hear you.  The food - very well prepared but not filling. As you may except from a high class seafood establishment. We had the Fiola Mare oysters & caviar, ahi tuna carpaccio, monkfish steak and under the sea. The caviar, spoonbill, was not great and overly salty. The oysters were very tasty. The tuna was delicious. The monkfish steak was very well put together. The under the sea dish had a bit of everything, branzino, scallop, lobster, prawn, mussels, foie gras and quinoa.  The seafood was fresh but again, not filling. I guess I expected a $50 plate to fill me up more.  Overall, good experience, I would rate them a 3.8 out of 5. Service is a 5 but because I felt a little robbed for paying so much and not being full, the food score drops below 4.",4,3,0,1

"Kieran M.","1/26/2015","Oceanside, CA","Enjoyed an absolutely delicious brunch yesterday. We did the four courses which included bottomless mimosas, prosecco, and a few other choices (not bloody Mary's, though, which was a little disappointing). The lobster soup was amazing, as were the poached eggs benedict. As for the service, it seemed as though our server was new. Obviously everyone must start somewhere, so that was fine.One thing I must point out is the hot chocolate. We ordered a chocolate milk for our daughter, but after waiting about 8 minutes, were told they only had hot chocolate. Hmm, I thought, but sure. When we got the check, the hot chocolate was..wait for it..$15.00! Don't get me wrong, it was not your average powdered stuff, but my god.  Moral of the story, unless you're head over heels for hot chocolate, skip it and have an additional starter or glass of wine.

"Patrick R.","1/31/2015","Washington, DC","Bottom line: overrated.  The food is mostly unremarkable and not good value for the very high prices you pay for it.  They charge ~$40-50 for what are run-of-the-mill fish entrees.  At that price, they should at least complement them with a vegetable.  Unless you prefer your entree ""neat"" (who does?), you are left to choose from their limited selection of ($12) uninspired sides.  And I don't understand the love fest for the $46 lobster ravioli; truly just okay and probably should be half the price.  The decor and furnishings are so-so, and the atmosphere is a bit pretentious.  The one (and I do mean one) bright spot was the attentive and friendly staff.  I have only myself to blame for trusting -- against my better instincts -- the hype.  It was a big letdown and I won't be back.",1,1,1,0

Two of us did the deluxe brunch for $48 a person and the other two ordered off the regular brunch menu. We all shared everything because everything was delicious and savory!

"Kelly B.","2/16/2015","Washington, DC","This review is based on my second experience at Fiola Mare.  My first time there was amazing and I was thoroughly impressed.  Unfortunately, the service at my last visit has completely tarnished my view of the restaurant.  Issues:1. Table: I made a reservation and I think they must have been over booked because they sat us in the bar area with a table that they carried in to make extra seating.  It was cramped and right in the middle of the walkway.  My companion is the non-confrontational type so I decided to bite my tongue and not say anything.  In hindsight, I wish I had asked for a different table. 2. Lack of server: Not once during my recent visit to Fiola Mare did a server come over and introduce him/herself as our server or welcome us to the restaurant.  We were shuffled between three people who failed to communicate with each other.  We also waited a significant amount of time before anyone came to our table at all. 3. Issue with fixed menu: We ordered off a fixed lunch menu from one woman and she said she would come back with the dessert menus for the last course later.  At the end of our meal, a different server came over and placed a ""complementary"" dessert on our table.  I tried to explain that we were to order our own, separate desserts (per the fixed menu), but he walked away without hearing what I had to say.  Thanks for generously giving us a dried out, nasty cinnamon roll... 4. Front of house guy who shouldn't be allowed to speak to patrons: A server or front of house guy, with whom we hadn't interacted at all, arbitrarily came by our table and said, ""wow, martinis at 3 pm... that's pretty bold"".  ....That's just rude and unnecessary.  The food is very good, but it's hard to justify paying that much money to be treated so poorly.",2,5,0,0

The salad was very delicate as well. The pasta had a very nice and flavorful light sauce. It was cooked perfectly and had a nice texture. The soufflé was fluffy and had creamy hazelnut inside. It was very sweet but enjoyable. The langoustine was also very good and came with a dip that tasted like capers paste. I love capers and it was very unique. The tagliatelle was pretty good but not my favorite.I would stick with he gragnano spaghetti and salad for appetizer and main course. the oyster and cavier came highly recommended but was anticlimactic due to the fact that it is basically in a creamy sauce and is overwhelmed by the cream. can't even tell you are eating oysters. better to get them from the raw bar probably.A last note on drinks - the pompelmo frizzante was a very good mocktailservice was very good and everyone was very attentive.

"Swatee G.","2/24/2015","Fairfax, VA","2 of my girl friends and I planned a fancy dinner at Fiola Mare, since it had been on our list of things to do for a while. We had reservations so we did not have to wait on this super chilly evening. The place is definitely an upscale VERY expensive date night kind of place - dimly lit and very romantic, it is actually gorgeous inside. I think we mostly saw couples all around us :) Anyways, my girlfriends and I were just looking to have a great time - we spent about 1.5 hours here with some really good wine and some average food. Yes, unfortunately my food experience here was kind of sub-par. The server started us off with some complimentary bread, which I did not think was very fresh - bummer!For an appetizer, we shared the burrata of buffalo mozzarella. I think everything on the plate worked - except the cheese! It's strange - I loved the mushrooms, the balsamic - everything but the texture of the cheese. I've had plenty of burrata style cheeses and there was just something off with this one, again kinda disappointed. We   ended up leaving the plate half way through.For my entree, I had the squid ink pasta which tasted yummy with lots of different sea food in it. Given that I ordered the dinner portion, I think the size was a little smaller than what I would have expected. One of my friends ordered the veggie pasta and she wasn't a fan of the marinara sauce. My other friend asked for the branzino I believe and that was probably the most successful dish on our table. For dessert, we shared the Marchesi - again, as with the burrata, it had some brilliant elements on the plate, but I don't think the dish came together as cohesively as it should have.  Regardless, we spent some quality time sipping on good wine, service was good and it was fun watching food being prepped in the kitchen - I was sitting facing the kitchen and got to see some real action :)Would I come back here? I honestly do not know yet. As much as I was in love with the idea of this place and the way it had been hyped, I was a little underwhelmed.

Was finally able to go for my husband's birthday and I must say that the service has gone down hill since my first visit. The wait staff was all over the place who gave my pregnant friend my cocktail drink and then when i send it back spilled it on my friends lap.  Also it took awhile for my husband to get his martini. Oysters were good though and the complimentary desserts and birthday card was a nice touch. Not sure if i will be back anytime soon.",2,1,0,0

"Saam T.","3/16/2015","Arlington, VA","Came for brunch with two friends and was a bit disappointed.  They do have a bottomless brunch option for $40, but we got there at 115, and were told that it ends at 2 so bottomless wasn't the best idea.  And the menu is limited for the bottomless, another reason we stayed away. We sat at a table, overlooking the Potomac, view was absolutely breath taking.  We ordered a pasta dish, forgot the name, but the most famous one on the menu, the lobster bisque and the steak and eggs.  Pasta tasted very fresh, but kind of a small portion.  The lobster bisque had a good amount of lobster meat in it, however the flavor wasn't really anything exciting, I have had better lobster bisque at food carts.  The steak and eggs were also flavorless, one egg on top of a filet.  It was ok, not bad, but nothing special either.We ordered many bloody Mary's, which tasted great, but for the life of me I didn't taste any alcohol.  I drank 4 of them and didn't even have a remote buzz.  Dessert we got the donuts and coffee ice cream.  Donuts were dry and the ice cream tasted like it had real bitter coffee beans in it, not what I was expecting.All in all, the ambience is breath taking, but the food and drinks are nothing special.  And the everything is a bit over priced, the bill for 3 of us with drinks was 215 after tax and tip, not worth it in my opinion.",3,2,3,1

Ok, on to the food and service, both excellent.  Tuna carpaccio, a ""signature dish"", was overpowered by condiments (a spicy tomato tapenade, black olives, capers, roe, onions, and God knows what else. Delicious, but no way you could taste the tuna. Buffalo mozzarella was very creamy and filling, but don't have it with seafood. Spaghetti with vongole (baby clams) was simply superb, as was the simply grilled cod with white asparagus.  Seafood feast from bottom of the sea ($50) was a feast for the eyes (a thin but spikey langoustine, 2 mussels, 2 baby clams, a slither of Branzino, and a dollop of foie gras in a magical brodetto of herbs that smelled divine), but left me wanting more.  Crostata of rhubarb, strawberries, and almonds was good, not great, but the tiny scoop of ice cream saved it.  Mini Cinnabon a la mode was a nice birthday surprise.

"Kate L.","4/5/2015","Baltimore, MD","Chef Trabocchi does it again. Fiola, Casa Luca and Fiola Mare are easily 3 of the best restaurants in DC. Had signature brunch here this weekend and it was a fantastic deal. $42 pp for unlimited cocktails (Bellini or Mimosa), the INSANELY good and overflowing fresh bread basket with a selection of warm, freshly baked sweet and savory breads, and 3 courses. The bread basket alone is probably worth the $42 with everything from perfect croissants that rival ones you get in France, blueberry cake, black pepper and cheese popovers, olive bread, etc. Each one better than the last. First course I got the lemon ricotta pancakes. Moist, light, buttery, lemony, and with a perfectly perfect whipped creme fresh-type topping. Served with whiskey-barrel aged maple syrup but I barely used any since the pancakes were so delightful on their own. The funny yet attentive and professional server accommodated my weird request to split my second course into two half-portions since I couldn't decide. Got the buccatini caco pepe--basically peppery adult cheese pasta. It was sharp, creamy, peppery and out of this world good. The other half was the tagliatelle with ganchiale, duck egg, mushrooms and leeks. If I was stranded on a dessert island with only one food item, this would be it. It was that good. Course 3 was a warm cinnamon roll with vanilla glaze and honey gelato. Do yourself and order this before you die. Wasn't too sweet. Boyfriend got the panna cotta and couldn't stop talking about how perfect it was. The atmosphere was calm, relaxing, and bright. Probably my favorite brunch I've ever had. Not ""probably,"" ""definitely."" DEFINITELY.",5,2,0,0
"Emily H.","4/6/2015","Anchorage, AK","Reservations are hard to come by in the week you want to go, but a fellow yelper and I managed to snag a 9:30 pm reservation on a Friday.  Needless to say, I was starving by the time we arrived, and couldn't wait to eat!We started with the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio.  Although I'm not a huge fish fan, I have been trying to be more open about trying different foods as I work my way through the ""100 best"" Washingtonian list. Sadly, this wasn't going to be a newly discovered favorite for me.  However, it must have been amazing because Matt happily finished both his and mine. For my main dish, I ordered the lobster bisque Cappuccino aka HEAVEN in a bowl! I am not sure I can even adequately express all of the amazing combination of flavors in this dish because there simply aren't words. Not only was the broth thick, rich and creamy, the portions of Maine lobster, sea scallops, and jumbo lump crab were generous in size and cooked perfectly.  My one and only complaint was that I never wanted to see the bottom of that bowl!Honestly, the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the fact that I'm not classy enough to disentangle price from portion size -- having several dishes may get you full, but it also leaves your pockets feeling much lighter. The polite and professional service coupled with a romantic and intimate interior make this place a great spot for special occasions though!",4,4,1,2
"Matt S.","4/7/2015","Bloomingdale, Washington, DC","Regardless of whether or not I agree with the statement that the Fiola Mare vibe suits me (the thoughts of the company that joined me during the meal), it's not the type of place I frequent. Delicious and casual are usually my cup of tea. No white linen table cloth, no real attention on my part towards service and no sommelier.  But, Fiola Mare makes you remember why high end restaurant dining exists. The ambiance is very nice inside and out, the service is great and the food is delicious.To start off the meal we went with a very nice white 'Bastianich' wine.  The food started out with the 'Ahi Tuna Carpaccio'.  Probably my least favorite dish out of everything that I tried, but still very good. The presentation of the dish was beautiful. My lack of enjoyment of capers most likely were what threw the dish off a little for me.  Otherwise the tomatoes, fresh beautiful tuna, and sorrel cream were all great.  The second starter we went with was the 'Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella' salad.  A creamy and complex dish of deliciousness.  The salad balances between creamy (burrata + oregano black truffle dressing) and fresh (spring peas + fava beans + pea leaves).   As an entree I decided on the chef's specialty, the lobster ravioli.  This dish was awesome.  The ravioli pasta was tender and delicious, filled with tender and delicious pieces of lobster.  The sauce was the perfect accompaniment, slightly creamy but fresh.  The meal was whimsical, and I don't think I've ever actually used that word.  The dishes were beautiful and delicate from both a visual and flavor standpoint.  If you're willing to drop quite a bit of money, I'd suggest a visit to Fiola Mare.",4,3,1,1

"Sandy T.","4/8/2015","Oakton, VA","First of all, I did not have high expectations for Fiola Mare, considering most of its neighboring restaurants on the board walk have failed me. I was highly surprised during my meal; the food was impeccable and service was top-notch! I'd have to say, Fiola Mare has to be one of Georgetown's best restaurants as of now. Definitely one of my current favorites. They have both indoor/outdoor patio seating and now that the weather is getting warmer, it's nice to sit out.They have a full bar and an extended wine list! My friend and I were debating whether or not we should order a bottle, but we have quite different wine preferences, so we ordered our own glasses. I'd have to say, they have one of the best Moscato wine I've had in a very long time. If you're wondering what Moscato wine is, it's essentially dessert wine; super sweet and bubbly. We came here at an odd hour, which was nearing the end of lunch and the beginning of dinner. Being my first time here, I wanted to try as many dishes as possible and neither my friend nor I were hungry so we ordered many small plates. The small plates weren't exactly small--it was a decent size. Recommendations:--Caviar-- it was a metal can filled with black fish eggs served with their house biscuits/tortilla chips/ sour cream...Delicious!--Maine lobster rolls--The rolls were awesome. Possibly one of the best lobster rolls I've had. it's MONEY! trust.--Wild Calamari--if you like spice, then this is definitely your dish. The red peppers they use in this dish gives it a good kick.--Smoked Salmon-- the smoked salmon was served on a pita bread. It was a little heavy in my opinion with the fish roe, but still delish!--Also, order white wine. It is a seafood restaurant and white wine pair with the dishes much better. 4 stars for the food5 stars for the amazing service! the staffs were very attentive and friendly.",5,8,6,7
"D E.","4/12/2015","Boulder, CO","Lovely restaurant on the Georgetown waterfront.  THE place you want to go for seafood or waterside dining in DC.  Great for visiting friends or family who want to go to Georgetown.  Nice for clients or business events.  I've always come with a reservation, but I think there are certain outdoor seats reserved for walk-ins. I've been to Fiola Mare once for dinner and twice for brunch.  First brunch: good service and OK food.  Dinner: good service and very good food, although menu was predetermined because it was a fixed-menu event so the food wasn't necessarily what I would have ordered.  Most recent brunch: terrible service (waited forever to order, had to re-order drinks multiple times, given only one pastry basket even though three people ordered the signature brunch package) but really delicious food.Favorites:  burrata salad (yum! but burrata could be creamer); scallops or fish simply grilled--great seasoning, straightforward, healthy; garlic spinach side; bloody mary; cinnamon bun dessertLess favorites: donuts (had a fishy taste... yikes); shrimp and gritsIn sum, 3.5 stars, based on three different trips, with the potential for 4.5 stars if it all came together during one visit.Food: 3.5 to 4.5 starsAmbiance: 5 starsService: 1 to 4 stars",4,0,0,0

"Olivia A.","4/15/2015","Washington, DC","All my seafood lovers out there, can I get a hell yeah?!Fiola Mare has been on our list for a while now and mom's bday was the perfect excuse to ball out. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance (supposedly the norm) and were seated almost immediately. Started off with a cocktail. I especially liked my vegetable garden, or whatever has the cucumber granita. It may have been described as an alcoholic gazpacho by my dining mates, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Started with a half dozen oysters, 3 each of both of the east coast varieties. Smaller is always more delicious in my book. The passion fruit sauce masked the oyster too much in my opinion. Go lemon spritz. We had to get that famous lobster bisque and it was truly delicious. The salad was actually surprisingly large and just the kind of rainbow garden that my winter ravaged body needs.Next course was the lobster ravioli, a half portion of the bucatini with sea urchin, and a whole branzino. Lobster ravioli, topped with more lobster meat (YUM), was delicious although beware that there are 3 big raviolis (we knew and ordered accordingly). Bucatini was complex and flavorful, although the sea urchin was a bit lost in all of the sauce. Fish was perfectly cooked: crunchy skin and soft, flaky meat. My only complaint was (and this is hardly a complaint) that the portions were bigger than we expected. In this case price tag is not inversely related to portion size. We were stuffed!The staff was also fantastic with my mother, giving us a chocolate cake and candle along with a goat cheese mousse with almonds and cherries. We were all smitten.I'll definitely be back. The bar is lively and fun, too!Tip: Dinner is great, but lunch might be the better time to get the view. Spring/summer with those windows opening onto the Potomac are going to be glorious!",5,14,3,6

"Richard T.","4/28/2015","Boulder, CO","Don't confuse this place with Fiola, although they are under same ownership.  Fiola is a class act with superior service, ambience and food.  Their Zagat rating supports this opinion.  I can't comment on the food at Fiola Mare as we walked out after being treated as just another customer with money to spend.  The GM at Fiola supposedly set up our reservation for us to ensure that we would have a nice table, not crammed into one of their small tables with no privacy and minimal noise.  Either they didn't get the message from Fiola GM or chose to ignore it as what we were offered was their typical cramped and noisy table. After we complained, they said we could wait (unwilling to tell us how long) and maybe something more to our liking would open up.  With that kind of response, we left.  What separates the great restaurants from places like Fiola Mare is the quality of the service and hospitality, whether a regular or a first timer.  You can get great food lots of places, but you have to search for the restaurants that will treat you as a special customer, not a piece of meat that will except anything for the ""privilege"" of dining at their establishment.  While you may pay more at Fiola, I think it is worth it because they will treat you as special, at least that has been our experience.  Find out for yourself.",1,3,1,1

"Christy D.","5/8/2015","Arlington, VA","I'm so disappointed with this restaurant. I took my best friend here for her birthday and we attempted to enjoy brunch. We had a reservation, arrived about 10min late but they said it's ok. We said we'd rather sit outside, hostess said ok, so we wait. Brunch ends promptly at 2pm, no exceptions. We asked the hostess if we could still do the bottomless brunch after 2 since we waited so long (about an hour) she said yes, since you had a reservation you can. We get seated at 2pm.... And we can't enjoy the bottomless brunch. We were upset asked to speak to the manager. He was so condescending to us and made us feel like it was our fault for waiting. He smiled the whole time telling us how sorry he was that his hostess told us we could still enjoy the $48 brunch, but he is saying no. He offered us 2 drinks to enjoy brunch but said no to accommodating the bottomless. After waiting and then dealing with his condescending attitude during this time we said absolutely not. We aren't 21 year olds trying to take advantage of your bottomless brunch, but the fact that he said no-- after his staff already said yes was unacceptable. He didn't care. It was horrible. It's cheap champagne not Dom! We then walked over to Sequoia on the waterfront and had the best service. The manager at sequoia was amazing to us and my best friend on her birthday.",1,4,2,1
"Mollie I.","5/11/2015","Washington, DC","It pains me to write this review because the original Fiola is one of our favorite restaurants. But our experience at Fiola Mare was just not good. We walked in with no reservations on a Saturday around 4:30pm. We knew we would probably sit at the bar area and that's fine. The bar area was so loud and it was also very very hot with the sun streaming in from the windows and no cross breeze. So it's not the most comfortable place to sit. But fine, we can suffer through if the food/service is great...which is what we were expecting at Fiola Mare. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Service was just fine. We waited quite a bit in to get approached by a server in the first place and it was pretty slow from the then on. Also, not once did they sweep up the table and we ordered 6 different courses. The oysters were served dry- not a one had their liquor reserved in the shell, which made them pretty tasteless. We had oysters that were 1000 times better at Clydes the next day. The Adriatic Seafood Platter- which is supposed to be their signature seafood entree- was served swimming in a pool of oil and everything tasted the same and the fish was overcooked and indistinguishable from type to type. It was such a disappointment. The crudo was good and the pasta was very good. The bomboloni dessert was also delicious, but overall for what we paid and we were expecting, we were thoroughly disappointed.",2,1,0,0

They are rude and not pleasant at all. They are the image of your establishment so they should be welcoming and treat guests with respect.   We used to come here to enjoy great food and a nice experience.  Will come back if you fix the major flaws but for now, I will go somewhere else where I could enjoy fine dining and good service.

"Tricia S.","5/24/2015","Alexandria, VA","This review is not for the food, but of their lack of humanity and I would give a negative rating if possible. I took some visiting family & friends on the water taxi ride from Alexandria to Georgetown on Saturday 5/16/15- the dock for the boat is in front of Fiola Mare.  While we were there a thunderstorm hit.  We had found shelter during the lighter rain, but then had to get back to the dock to board the boat back to Alexandria.  Well, that is when the severe part of the storm hit and there is not shelter so we ducked under the umbrella from the restaurant.  There were 4 large umbrellas and we were under the one furthest away from the only customer they had still sitting under there and the area was not going to be used because it was wet and no one could sit there with the rain.  After a few moments, an employee came over and without saying a word began closing the umbrella that we were under - leaving us out in the pouring rain.  They did not close any of the other umbrellas.  Now, I would understand if we were impeding their business(which we were not), but a little communication would have been nice and our party would have ordered drinks while we waited for the boat.  This goes beyond poor guest service, but a lack of concern for people overall.  I work in the service industry and I go out of my way to make my guests comfortable- even if they are not spending any money at that time.  It's about common decency because acts of kindness are remembered.  But I guess unless you are the DC elite, you don't matter.  Shame on you.  I have dined a couple of times here and will never return.  There are many other fabulous restaurants in the DC area.",1,2,1,1
"Megan Q.","5/24/2015","Washington, DC","We decided to take a last minute walk down to the waterfront. We were stopped at the door because we didn't meet the dress code. I appreciate this. The inside of the restaurant is lovely and everyone dining here was dressed very well. They did seat us outside on the patio which was exactly what we were looking for anyway. The servers all seemed friendly but no one could match the charm the man greeting folks at the door had! I think his name was Matt West. He did it all. I saw him greeting people, explaining the dress code politely to person after person sauntering in off their boat or Sunday stroll, helping the valet, seating people, adjusting the shade curtains and so on. This guy is amazing and seems to remember all of the regulars by name. Fiola Mare is lucky to have him at the door, what a gentleman. The food was perfectly timed and tasty. I can't say it was a 5 star dining experience but nothing was wrong. My husband had the Smoke on the Water cocktail which he said was really good. I would highly recommend coming back here just to try a drink at the bar. The cocktails all looked really fabulous. We had the burrata of buffalo mozzarella to start. We shared this and they plated it on 2 separate plates which was so nice since this can be messy to share and I had a terrible head cold. I had the bucatini for my entree and my husband had the salmon off the ""simply grilled"" section with a side of spinach. I don't think he was wowed with the dish but it was off the ""simply..."" section. :)  The soft shell crab that sat on top of my bucatini was delicious. Everything else seemed like and afterthought but that soft-shell crab was cooked and seasoned perfectly. After that, it seemed like our server went on break for a while. We enjoyed the people watching and eventually flagged down someone to bring us a check. It's possible we didn't get the full dining experience on the patio. I would return to eat inside in the restaurant and I would return to have a cocktail at the bar any day. Make reservations and come dressed.",4,1,0,3
"Jonathan D.","5/24/2015","Vienna, VA","If you're not a seafood fan or struggle with congestion and large crowds not the place for you.Located  on the water very crowded outside and in.  Inside the restaurant can be very loud.  Service is great team based servers swarm whenever there is need.  Endless combinations of fresh seafood with multiple varieties of clams, oysters, and muscles.  Unique edgy condiments and dressings.  Burrata Buffalo Mozzarella appetizer was very good.  Cheese was soft and milky.  Soft Shell Crab season just began and they were delicious, lightly breaded and fried served with a thicker spaghetti known as Bucatini.  Bombolini dessert was delicious.  Four tables around us ordered it.  Fried dough balls coated with granulated sugar served with caramel dipping sauce and vanilla ice cream.  The three combined into one bite was sinful.  Everything is made in house.  Wait staff is very knowledgeable.  The presentation of the dishes are very important.  Seating available outside and in.  Valet service available 16 dollars when validated, 25 otherwise.  Pretty pricey.  Nothing is cheap.  Tasting items are featured heavily.  Tequila and whiskey tasting options available.  Seafood towers for different looks.  Cheese plates, etc Restaurant is very nice and accommodating for special occasions.  Reservations are necessary and they will take a credit card number to hold it in case of cancellations and no shows.",5,1,0,0
"Marissa L.","5/26/2015","Mission Viejo, CA","Amazing food as well as service. We didn't have reservations here. We got here early and got seats at the bar. This place is super fancy, but they do not fool around with their food. Everything is fresh and at a very good quality. We got here around happy hour so we ordered lower priced appetizers immediately. Even at lower prices this stuff was expensive. We got fried artichoke, fried calamari, a cheese plate and of course oysters. The fried artichoke would have been great if they had just taken the fuzzy and spiky insides out of the artichoke. You can't eat that part, or at least I don't like to. It really should have been removed. The artichoke was perfectly crispy though, it shattered like glass when you bit into it. The calamari was ok, I'm not a big fan so I'm not the best judge of calamari. The cheese plate was on the skimpy side. There was only a two inch piece of cheese with a lot more crackers, fruit and almonds. Although the almonds were delicious I ate most of those. The oysters here were perfect, fresh and clean. We went big on our entree, since it was our last day on vacation. We had traveled half way around the world and were on our way home. It was our last chance to treat ourselves. We split their raw seafood platter for three. It had everything you could think of, crab, prawns, (those were cooked then chilled), clams, mussels, oysters, salmon, tuna, uni, jellyfish and seaweed salad. The chilled crab legs were filled with succulent meat. You didn't even need butter it was so good. The prawns were huge, bigger than my hand. Super meaty and perfectly cooked. I've never had raw clams or mussels before and I think it's the best way to eat them. The clams were sweet and salty. The mussels were topped with a spicy sauce that complimented their plain yet substantial flavor. Oysters of course were like drinking clean seawater. The raw fish was ok, they were chopped very finely which made them kinda tough and firm. I gave uni a second chance. It wasn't as bad as the first time I ate it, but I'm still not a fan. It tastes like drowning in a fury of waves when the yucky salt water gets all up in your nose. My Dad was a surfer though so he loved the uni. I gave the rest of it to him. The big surprise was the jellyfish. It was more of a texture than a taste. I thought it would be like spongy jello, but it was more crisp and crunchy. It had an interesting crunch, similar to the crunch in seaweed or kelp that you sometimes get. An amazing discovery. The seaweed salad was a little wet and goopy, I sorta like seaweed salad, sometimes. Not really my thing. Overall I totally recommend their raw platter. It is worth every dollar. It's an experience all on it's own. Finally for dessert we had a sort of blackberry bundt cake topped with a mix of mascarpone and goat cheese. Very balanced and wonderful dessert. The sweet and a little sour blackberries with the rich cheese topping was perfect. If you love goat cheese this is the dessert for you, it's really the star of this dish. Light, fluffy, rich, creamy, sweet and sour what a way to end a memorable meal.",4,0,0,0
"Alicia F.","5/29/2015","Alexandria, VA","Wow -- this place is absolutely amazing. Beautiful views, great food, and top notch service. It's pricey, and definitely a special occaision venue, but I'll definitely be back.Food: Really, really good. I loved that they serve the pasta dishes half sized, so you can order them as a first course or as a small plate with other food. I had the sea urchin bucatini, which was rich and really savory. My husband had the clam chitara, which had tons of clams. He also ordered the hamachi sashimi, and I had the grilled calamari, with a side of rapini. The calamari was the best I've ever had -- grilled, not fried, minimally seasoned, and tender (not chewy!). We also had desserts--the donut dish was fabulous (especially the sauce), and I had the chocolate/earl gray panna cotta. I was ready to roll away at the end, but it was amazing.Service: Probably the best I've ever had at a restaurant. Our waiter was super knowledgeable about everything on the menu. When a large group was seated near us, a manager apologized, and when we asked if they would mind asking the group to stop taking flash photography (it was late, in a dimly lit restaurant, and they had a paparazzi style photographer bouncing around between tables with a huge flash), they told them to stop. They even comped us desserts for the problem -- even though we insisted that it was fine. They also noticed that it was my husband's birthday (I gave him a card, but didn't say anything to the restaurant) and put a candle in his dessert and brought us extra gelato. Really top notch.",5,0,1,0
"Diane B.","5/29/2015","Vienna, VA","If I had written this review 3 weeks ago, it would have been a 5 star review about how they treated me and my well dressed friends and as queens on our girls night out. Unfortunately, I chose to return with my husband and friends for dinner last Saturday.  Since it was a gorgeous night, we chose to arrive 45 minutes early for drinks in the beautiful setting. We asked where we could drink with a view, and were taken by someone at the front desk to the table outside by the front door. Bottom line, we were there  40 minutes and never got drinks, and only got a confused server after flagging one down. When we went to our table, I expressed dissatisfaction, and we were given each a glass from a $15 bottle of prosecco. By the way, the table- in the corner of the back of the small, interior room- was the worst seat in the house, by the waiter work station. Service continued to be slow throughout the evening. While the raw bar was excellent, some in the party felt the main courses were not worth the price. I truly felt disrespected, and like they would rather we were not there. We will take our $370 per couple elsewhere next time.",2,1,1,0
"Karen S.","5/29/2015","Waltham, MA","The food definitely lived up to my expectations, but the service (and even the famed view) was a bit lacking.We came for an early Mother's Day brunch (good thing we didn't go the day of-- that menu was really expensive!) and were seated just inside the doorway leading to the back patio. It was kind of a weird place; we didn't get much of a view of the river, and the tables in our area were pretty close together. We got three of the full brunch menus ($48 each), which includes bread, an appetizer, a choice of a brunch entree or pasta, and dessert. You can also get bottomless mimosas, sangria or bellinis and you can switch between the drinks, which is nice. For me, I tried their mocktails (also an option) since I don't drink, and while that's not as good of a deal, the grapefruit-lime soda was not to sweet and really refreshing. There was a fantastic mix of croissants and sweet pastries, along with some olive rolls and breadsticks in the bread basket. However, it wasn't a lot of bread for supposedly three brunch meals worth of bread. If you want any extra, they charge you for it! We chose one each of the appetizers: a ""colors of the garden"" salad, a burrata salad and smoked salmon piadina. The burrata was probably the best-- oozy and gooey and perfectly creamy with the peppery arugula. The salad with strawberries wasn't bad, but nothing really special. The smoked salmon was really yummy, especially with the pesto, but the flatbread under it was kind of hard-- the dish was better without it. For entrees, definitely don't get the pancake or french toast brunch options! It makes the whole thing not worth it, which we should realized while we were there. The two pastas were the best part of the meal: The spaghetti with tomato sauce and clams seemed so simple but every bite was just perfect. The tomatoes in the sauce were so luscious, broken down perfectly in the olive oil. The clams were fat and juicy (despite a little sand). The carbonara was basically breakfast in pasta form. The duck egg, guanciale and everything else came together to create a super rich but delicious dish. We also got two entree a la carte: The shrimp and grits and the steak and egg. The steak and egg was good but nothing nothing particularly special. The shrimp and grits on the other hand, featured wonderfully spiced, giant tiger shrimp, which when lifted, revealed a whole bunch of greens, roasted red peppers and bits of chorizo over creamy grits. All those little additions really helped round out the dish, since I feel like shrimp and grits can be kind of boring at other places. Our favorite dessert was the bomboloni: hot ricotta donuts rolled in sugar, served with chocolate-espresso gelato. It comes in the cutest little fryer basket, too! The others were fine but not remarkable.Our server seemed disinterested in us and frequently disappeared for long periods of time (he actually changed from a button-down shirt with a vest into a polo shirt during the middle of our meal), when we couldn't wave him down. He wasn't particularly welcoming as we sat down and basically showed up just to take our order. We had such fantastic dishes that I'd love to come back and have those again (and try more seafood), but next time I'll focus more on the a la carte options and see if I can get a better seat.",4,2,0,0

"Joel E.","6/4/2015","Washington, DC","We went to Fiola Mare for brunch on Sunday, May 31st.  My wife and I took our friend there as a belated birthday gift.  I had read some Yelp reviews prior to going since we had never been before, many of them referencing a snobby attitude and/or dress code issues and/or high prices.  Although the prices are very high, I did not experience anything but a pleasant and professional vibe from everyone I encountered there.  I did notice several male customers wearing shorts though, which surprised me considering the general comments I had read before going that seemed to indicate that some kind of dress code was going to be enforced.The restaurant is situated on the Georgetown waterfront and manages to pull off a casual yet elegant appearance.  We were seated just inside the outdoor patio so we were able to have a nice view without having to deal with the heat and humidity that sitting outside would bring.Now to the food:Brunch is $48.00 per person but includes bottomless drinks, a pastry basket, and three courses.  Bottomless drinks can be cocktails or mocktails or coffee.  The cocktail choices include mimosas, bellinis, and sangria.  For some reason my personal brunch staple; a bloody mary, is not one of the choices and they will not allow you to substitute it for the allowable cocktail choices.  We tried the burrata and smoked salmon piadina for the first course.  My wife loved the burrata and our guest and I loved the smoked salmon piadina, which is like a salad with smoked salmon and a burrata spread all on a flatbread.  It was a generous portion and again a pleasant surprise based on some reviews I read that mentioned less than stellar portions.For the main course you can choose from a selection of entrees and pastas.  Our guest chose the poached eggs w prosciutto on a biscuit and my wife and I chose the ""tortilla espanola"" which is basically a wedge of egg and potato quiche (they described it as a slice of an omelette) with seafood on the side.  It was all delicious.For dessert we tried almost all of the offerings, which ranged from a cinnamon roll to bomboloni (almost like little doughnuts).  Everything was again beyond delicious. The staff brought our guest an extra dessert on the house to help celebrate our guest's birthday, which was appreciated.I have to mention a few other points:The great: The restaurant wasn't busy when we were there, and that seemed to result in the staff allowing everyone including us to have an unbelievably leisurely and unhurried brunch.  We were there almost three hours (!) and never felt rushed. I can't imagine that could ever happen if they had been busy but again we certainly appreciated it.  Next, the staff seemed to notice when we were nearing the end of a round of drinks and brought a new round without us having to ask.  That was a nice touch and seems rare to nonexistent at other places that offer the the bottomless drink deal.The not-so-great:  Our main server seemed to disappear about halfway through brunch.  Now it's possible that because the restaurant has a team of folks serving each table that the main server didn't feel they needed to be as attentive, but we honestly thought he either 1) forgot about us or 2) decided he was going to pay more attention to the larger parties that were going to get him a bigger payday. Since I have seen this issue mentioned in several other reviews as well it may require that Fiola Mare address this with their wait staff.Finally, Fiola Mare is really, really expensive.  I know this is DC.  I know it's located in Georgetown.  But I still think it's a shame that we've come to this.  Close to $200.00 with tip for brunch for three people.  We knew what we were getting into but it's still hard to take.  I would have given them five stars if the main server had been a little more attentive and if their prices were just a bit more reasonable.Overall though, the entire brunch experience at Fiola Mare came close to living up to the hype and the prices.  We were impressed!",4,3,0,0

As you can see from my other reviews he and I do a fair amount of fine dining in the DMV. This experience in my opinion is why I enjoy fine dining so much, the experience of quality food and exceptional service. I called to make reservations in April and I was told there were no opening that week! I became obsessed and finally was able to get in the following week. I informed them it was his birthday and they went all out. My dad NEVER gets impressed. We both ordered drinks and the manager brought his over. I think the manager and my dad were astonished at each other's knowledge of bourbon, they traded distributor secrets and laughed over the legendary prices that Pappy was demanding these days. The drinks were phenomenal and for dining, I am a sad creature of habit. I of course had west coast oysters which were fantastic, maybe some of the best I have had in DC. I honestly forgot what the old man ordered for his app but I do remember him not saying anything negative, which is always a sign it met his expectations (like when o was in college!). For dinner I had the Branzino and he the calamari. Both were delicious but the calamari in my opinion was the show stopper. It was platted table side and was the most tender I had ever had. We were both stuffed but 'Fiola' herself stopped by to check on us. She's as every bit as sexy as her restaurant. She brought dads birthday desert and card!

"Olga N.","6/26/2015","Fairfax, VA","Ugh. This was one of those unpleasant experiences you just don't want to think about. I felt like I had to write a review though - I don't feel like ever coming back but other yelpers can keep it in mind.My parents were in town for the weekend and we found ourselves strolling around Georgetown on a Sunday night. I love Fiola downtown and wanted to try Fiola Mare for quite some time now. We didn't have reservations but the place didn't seem to be too busy from the outside, so we decided to go in. As we walked in, we saw three empty tables on the terrace. The hostess greeted us and asked whether we had reservations. We said we didn't. She looked down at us like we were some second-class citizens and said she would check whether they had available tables. What about those 3 empty tables on the terrace? Ah, they are reserved. OK. She slowly walked us through the restaurant  to see if they had availability on their second terrace (looking very much like she was doing us the biggest favor - seriously?) Again, what about all those empty tables inside the restaurant? Oh, they are also reserved? All of them? OK. Well, apparently the wait for a table on another terrace was 40 mins - longer than we wanted to wait after such pretentious treatment we've received, so we left.As soon as we left, I checked Opentable, just out of curiosity, and of course they had open reservations within 15 mins. As we walked around the water, 40 minutes later on our way back we saw those empty tables still empty...Shame on you, Fiola Mare.

The Adriatic mix grill was the highlight of our meal. Lobster, calamari, longostines, scallops and a couple of different types of fish perfectly cooked in a simple garlic butter sauce. The thinly shaved garlic put it over the top.Overall: I am only giving the place 3 stars because it is very expensive and there are equivalent seafood restaurants in DC that offer a much better value.

It's better in the summer. And this is coming from someone who melts like the Wicked Witch of the West in DC heat. The patio is lovely, with plush seating, and perfect views of the river with added primo G-Town people watching. Plus, they added new summer-y stuff to the menu, so now you can gorge yourself and feel like slightly less of a pufferfish afterwards. Perhaps, for just one glimmering moment, as the sun sinks into the Potomac and bathes your delicious shellfish feast in a warm happy glow, you'll realize DC isn't that bad after all. (And then you'll walk back to your car, find an inexplicable 50 dollar ticket and the illusion will be shattered. Speaking purely hypothetically, of course.)",5,3,3,6
"Elisa B.","7/10/2015","Boca Raton, FL","Found the place very easily. Right on the water which is what ive been told. I was hoping there would be a place where i could sit outside to have brunch but since I was by myself i decided to eat at the bar. There was a perfect bar all the way in the back which was still very open to the outside and could see the view but the hostess said it was closed. So i went to the inside bar. Met Tom the bartender. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Explained the menu to me since it was my first time here. Ended up with the french toast which was amazing! And they have real maple syrup!!!",4,0,0,1

"M R.","7/13/2015","Vienna, VA","Good food, no complaints about the food. I like that when you order things to share they prepare each of you a plate as opposed to bringing 1 plate that you split up yourself. We ordered many dishes to get to try as much as we could, so that was fantastic. We went for our 5 year anniversary. This was made clear when making the reservation. My boyfriend requested that we be seated outside for our special dinner. This was a month in advance. They made a note on our reservation to be seated outside. I called the day before our dinner to confirm that the note was indeed on our reservation and to reiterate the request. We get there, almost  all of the outdoor tables were empty, so we should have gotten one of them. They seated us inside. We asked the hostess to be seated outside as our reservation said, she told us the tables were reserved. Reserved?!?! We reserved ours a month ago. Nobody said we couldn't have it. We explained the occasion etc and nothing. They wouldn't budge. Thanks for trying to make our night special Fiola :/... The worst part, throughout our entire dinner, there were multiple outdoor tables that remained empty from start to finish. Very unaccommodating elitist atmosphere.",3,0,0,0

"Raisa C.","7/20/2015","Alexandria, VA","We never even sat down....that's where this review is going. Like a lime-light special, with raving reviews and a superb menu to match, I was sold. Needless to say I had been wanting to visit the place for a while. Finally, after 2 months, the opportunity came! I had a lunch with a client and what better place to take them to than beautiful Georgetown? Considering the weather has been crap and the sun finally decided to make a debut Thursday. I called the restaurant at 10AM to inquire about reservations for the same day. Per their hours seating for lunch ends at 230PM. I told them we would be there at 230PM, our client could only do a late lunch, and I ENSURED to ask if this would be a problem. They said ""no not at all, as long as you're here we can seat you."" We get there 2:26PM, boom made it earlier! The hostess tells me it's perfectly fine we can still be seated. She takes us down to the outdoor patio, we requested to be sat outside, the hostess at the patio whispers something to her and shows her a sign. The hostess then turns around and say's ""I'm sorry but let's go back upstairs."" We go back upstairs and she tells me to hang tight for a second. A second turned into 15 minutes later. Then we get told that the kitchen is closed and if we want we can grab ""bar bites."" My questions:1) WHY TELL US WE CAN STILL BE SEATED AND SERVED IF WE ARRIVE AT 230?2) WHY DID WE WAIT 15 MINUTES TO BE TOLD THAT THE KITCHEN IS CLOSED? Not only have we wasted time but we are now even hungrier. So needless to say we got frustrated and left because by this point we were just a bit disappointed with a lot of annoyed. Oh let me also add, the Valet drivers were rude and had attitude. They were a ""cash only"" service and the ATM was not that far. So we requested if we could leave the car parked there real quick, because we all know how lovely the parking situation is in Georgetown, but they refused to let us leave the car parked. Then they proceed to tell us the garage is cheaper. WHICH WAS NOT, IT WAS $20. Last questions:1) WHY WOULD YOU KILL BUSINESS BY:a) Being rude with attitude?b) Non accommodating, considering this restaurant is not your Maggiano's and with that said a certain level of customer service is expected.  A simple ""No, I'm sorry but it's policy that all drivers be present with their car"" or make something up! c) Direct business to another OTHER location?If Management is unaware of how situations like these are handled...well hopefully now they know and now you know.

"Riva L.","7/25/2015","Harlem, Manhattan, NY","We went to Fiola Mare for dinner last night because I had a serious craving for seafood and a patio dinner.  There was a little confusion over sitting us -- they repeatedly tried to seat us inside even though I made it pretty clear that I wanted to sit outside.  I mean, OK, we rolled up on a warm Saturday night with no reservations, so understandable if there isn't room on the patio.  We ended up sitting on the back patio, which has less of a view than the front patio but is still a nice way to enjoy the weather and is beautifully decorated, and I appreciated that they found a way to accommodate what I wanted. We started with drinks - Mom got a negroni and I got a glass of Sancerre.  They put the wrong alcohol brand in her negroni, but our waitress apologized and offered to trade it in.  I got a glass of white wine and they brought out the bottle to pour it for me.  I don't know a lot about white wine and I misread the label and thought they'd brought me the wrong one, which I pointed out.  Turned out I was wrong - probably better to avoid criticism if you know almost nothing! - but what was great that even though this place is very expensive and has a decidedly fancy atmosphere, the waitress was not at all snobby or condescending about my mistake.  I've definitely had experiences at other restaurants like this with snobby servers.  Our server - I don't remember her name, she was blonde with her hair in braids - was so kind, attentive, friendly, and helpful. And the wine was good :).We got the colors of the garden salad to split.  We asked for the dressing on the side and they still mixed it in, but at least they didn't put it on too heavy.  It was, however, way to vinegary/ sour, which took away from the enjoyment of the dish.  The salad itself was absolutely beautiful - they don't exaggerate with the name, it's so dang colorful.  There are edible flowers that don't add much to the flavor but are quite pretty.  I liked the cherries, the cheese, and the nuts a lot.For our dinner, I got the lobster ravioli and mom got the shrimp rigatoni.  Both were phenomenal.  At first, we thought they had accidentally given us the half portion of lobster ravioli because there were three ravioli and two pieces of lobster.  Our waitress assured us that this was an ample serving and I doubted her, but she was right.  The ravioli pyramids were huge and filled with great, visible chunks of lobster.  This is so much better than when people make lobster ravioli and fill it with ground up lobster/ cheese -- I always feel ripped off with that.  It was rich, flavorful, and delicious; and it was definitely very filling.  The lobster -- both in the ravioli and on its own on the plate (a claw and a tail piece) was perfectly cooked and flavored.  The sauce was creamy yet light.  I could not taste at all the ginger that was supposedly in the dish, but I still really loved the whole thing.The shrimp rigatoni was amazingly flavored.  It had tomatoes, chili, capers, and Rosemary (and bread crumbs for crunch) and combined, they made a delicious, rich, warm sauce.  The worst part about this dish was honestly the shrimp itself.  It was way too hard and had a weird texture.  I did not enjoy the piece that I tried.  Also, there were only two pieces of shrimp on this shrimp dish, which was a little odd to me.  I'd expect more.  Still, the flavors of the dish were out of this world.Altogether, I opted not to give this place five stars because: 1) the hostesses were snooty 2) they messed up two aspects of our order, the drink and the salad3) two pieces of badly cooked shrimp on a shrimp pasta dishHowever, in this case, the good SERIOUSLY outweighed the bad.  Our waitress was truly excellent, the atmosphere was lovely, and I really enjoyed the food for the most part. An excellent dining experience altogether.",4,1,0,0

"Diane B.","8/3/2015","McLean, VA","OK, so this place is really 4.5 stars, but the bill kept me from rounding up.  I had been wanting to come for a while, and my husband and I got reservations for a lovely summer Friday night.  We sat inside because it was in the 90's and he was wearing a tie.  The food was all tasty -- we split the andouille seafood ceviche, tuna tartare, and dorade royal.  The food was well cooked and flavorful.  The tuna had an interesting cream which complemented the food nicely.  When we were ready to leave, we got the bill with a suggested tip on it.  Call me old fashioned, but I find it so tacky when the bill comes with tip suggestion.  Especially a 22% tip.  If you want a nice tip, let me decide it on my own, and you'll probably be more happy than if you suggest it/add it yourself.  Not a classy move by an otherwise classy restaurant.",4,1,0,0

Celebrating my birthday, we started with a couple of cocktails in the bar. Friendly service and great drinks. We were than seated near a window and had a great view. We shared the rockfish crudo for our appetizer. Fresh and sweet! We also asked the sommelier for recommendations to match each of our courses. She asked a couple of questions and then stopped by to see how we liked each selection she chose. Highly recommend doing this as she chose great wines!For dinner, I had the Under the Sea which had great selection of lobster, scallops, Bronzino, and foie gras! The broth poured around the seafood selection was to die for. I wanted to drink it! My husband had rigatoni with shrimp and uni. He loved it, but didn't feel the uni was noticeable. For dessert, you must try the bomboloni. Hot donuts served with ice cream and a decedent topping. We also got a couple of Bon bons which were small but very rich. For my birthday, they brought me a passion fruit dessert. They also gave us a lovely chocolate dessert. Our table was covered with dessert! (Not complaining!)Our waiter was the best! Great recommendations and gave detailed explanation of the dishes. We asked for a cab and he even walked us out when it arrived.

"Jessica F.","8/10/2015","Richmond, VA","Fiola Mare's reputation preceded itself and it was refreshing to come to a seafood restaurant as a vegetarian knowing that I had many options to choose from.There was a long wait (about an hour and a half at prime brunch hour) so we found 2 seats at the bar almost immediately instead which were first come first serve.  Before we sat, we did wait a couple minutes for an older gentleman to settle up and I noted how patient and helpful the servers were as he helped the older man look for something he lost.  That kind of service is always great to see and it's the kind of service you can expect here no matter who you are.  SO we took a seat and sipped from fresh Bellini's as my friend and I chose several Brunch dishes to split.    We started with the Mozzarella Burrata which was out of this world.  I've never had a Burrata made with fruit and it was such a wonderful combination of flavors, with sweet peaches, mint, juicy yellow tomato with a delicious pesto.   Next, we opted to try their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which were also amazing...it wasn't too rich and it had a compote of blueberries to pour on top of it.  As someone who doesn't like maple syrup, I really enjoyed having a pancake that had flavor in and of itself.   Their tomato and basil cavatappi my friend and I split was a pleasant  light and simple summer homemade pasta dish with a cherry tomato and basil sauce.I will definitely be returning there in the future.",4,1,0,1

My only complaint was the man refilling my water. He would always awkwardly lean over me or put his whole arm in front of my face to refill my partially used water glass. It was so annoying! I also found it odd the bread basket isn't served with oil or butter.",5,1,0,2

Fiola Mare is situated on the river, which river I do not know, but the atmosphere is beautiful especially if you happen to luck up and find a seat on their open air patio. By the way, please make sure that you have a reservation because if not, then you are SOL; you don't want to get challenged by the doormen and go off, like I did. So spare yourself the drama. The only con is that they serve their bread cold, which I can't stand, but the Lobster Ravioli made up for it in more ways than one. DAMN!!

"Marie H.","8/14/2015","Alpharetta, GA","My husband and I went to this place for our first date night since the birth of our 10 week old daughter.  I'm a big fan of Italian food and seafood, so I was excited to try this place.  As usual, we went all out.  We first tried the Fiola Mare oysters and caviar, which was pretty creative and really good.  The broth the oysters were in had a bright and fresh flavor.  We also ordered the burrata of buffalo mozzarella, which I highly recommend.  The burrata was really creamy and the added fruit made for a great combination. Our main dishes were also good.  I had the grilled monkfish and my husband ordered the halibut dish.  Both dishes were good, but overpriced for what we got.  We also then ordered two desserts - the Bomboloni and the Honey Blueberry Éclair.  The eclair was just okay and we left it half eaten, but we ended up eating all of the bomboloni.  You can't go wrong with doughnuts and butterscotch sauce. The service was mediocre; we waited awhile for the waiter to come around and take our order and had slow service throughout the course of our meal.  I've had much better/attentive service at other high end restaurants.  We went on a Saturday night so the place was pretty busy, which may be why the service was a little lacking.  I highly recommend making reservations for this place if you plan on going on a Fri. or Sat. night since the place gets pretty packed. Overall, I gave a four star rating, since albeit  we were pleased with all the dishes we tried, the place was rather over priced. You are basically paying for the ambience and view of the Potomac (if you're lucky).",4,0,0,0

Perhaps because we were celebrating an anniv, the pastry chef sent a dessert, the Caramel Bubino. It was like eating sweet air, except with perfect calories. LOL. We had already ordered the Bomboloni and ""Marchesi"", so our table was full of treats! Just listening to Johnny describe the ""Marchesi"" is a treat and I think they put it in quotes because it's HIDEOUSLY SCRUMPTIOUS!This dinner was definitely Top 5 worldwide for us! The IALW is unsurpassed, but it's like going to church - hushed and proper. What we liked better about Fiola Mare is the lively buzz - it's fun, and people like Johnny (our server), Will (our sommelier), Phillipe and Wong make it so, as well as the eclectic, beautiful and interesting patrons.

"Gina C.","8/18/2015","Arlington, VA","Oh, I love me a good posh brunch spot.Yeeees, it's a bit pretentious, as is the service, but that's what I love about it. I came to Fiola Mare for brunch to be dressed up, people watch, and have phenomenal food. And you know what? Fiola Mare delivered.My girlfriend and I came here for Sunday brunch at noon and got seated inside. Pro tip: If you want to sit on the deck or outside, you have to make a reservation at least three weeks in advance, according to the manager. Regardless, seating inside was comfy, lovely, and not too loud. I always appreciate a quiet enough interior to actually have a conversation. We went with the $48 brunch special which comes with unlimited coffee and your choice of bellini, mimosa, or sangria. Go with the bellinis- they're amazing. Also, way to go Fiola Mare for using La Marca Prosecco across the bellini and mimosa spectrum. Actually using a prosecco I'd keep in my house for your breakfast cocktail and not Andre or some other crap? Well done.Pro tip number two: you must choose one antipasti/salad, either a pasta/brunch favorite item, and a dessert. You don't get to mix and match, which makes me sad, because I don't really eat pasta, didn't need dessert, and those brunch favorites were calling my name.I got the smoked salmon piadino, which was really lovely. The salmon was not at all fishy, the mozzarella was stretchy, and the greens and tomatoes were fresh. The pesto was a bit meh, but altogether delicious. My friend got the garden vegetable salad and it was lovely. Fresh figs for the win.She went with the french toast with peaches while I ordered the uova in caponato for our brunch favorite choices. The french toast is superb, especially when complemented by barrel aged bourbon maple syrup. Peaches were at the perfect ripeness. The uova in caponata is surprisingly rich, and again, was perfectly prepared. Lots of fresh veggies and perfectly sunny side up eggs with just enough runniness. The grilled bread had lovely char. Two thumbs up.The best part of the brunch, however, is the bomoboloni with salted caramel sauce. Oh my god. We were both so full but regardless, stuffed all but one of our doughnuts into our faces. They were still hot, yeasty, and freshly rolled in sugar. The salted caramel sauce is the perfect match. For sixty bucks apiece, we had phenomenal food, charming service, a great chat with the manager (Thanks, Rocky!), and altogether a fabulous time. We were there for well over two hours without being shooed out. Now that is service.Til next time, Fiola Mare!",4,0,0,1

"Cat L.","8/23/2015","Gaithersburg, MD","I'm not a huge fan of the brunch options, but everything else about this place is top-notch - I'd love to come back here for a nice dinner. We had a large group of 12 for Sunday brunch and were seated in a private room. The room alone was amazing, since we had double doors separating us from the rest of the restaurant and had a beautiful patio door leading to the deck. Service was very attentive and professional throughout the entire meal, as expected from such an upscale place.  The brunch menu only has a limited number of offerings and aren't really worth it - some of the basic non-seafood brunch options (i.e. pancakes and eggs benedict) were way too overpriced. I ordered the eggs benedict, split a raw bar with 4 people, and also loaded up on the delicious bread basket and was completely stuffed. The eggs benedict were good but unimpressive given the hiked up price. if you're a seafood lover, then the raw bar will definitely make you happy! There were oysters, scallops, crab, lobster, mussels, and shrimp, and it all came with 3 sauces (not sure what they were - cocktail sauce wasn't among them), but the seafood was very fresh and good enough to eat raw.If you feel like drinking, you can do the boozy brunch with unlimited drinks and a choice of 3 courses. Others in our group did this, and I thought it was a good way to drink but that the menu choices were too few to have made it a better deal.",4,0,0,2

"Carole M.","8/25/2015","Reston, VA","Though the restaurant has a great location, and is a pretty place, the food is mediocre, the portions small & overpriced. The $32 veal ravioli dish my husband ordered comes with no sides. Not even a small side salad. The ravioli was under cooked & scarce on filling. My lobster with pasta dish had tiny non-recognizable shredded pieces of lobster mixed in with the pasta.  It was not flavorful, and again, like my husbands, was not an adequate portion.  We eat out out at least 5 times a week, being empty nesters, at a variety of restaurants.  The foods we've eaten at our local Cracker Barrel restaurant taste a lot better than we had at Fiola Mare.  Their good reviews must be coming from employees or one of these companies that a business can hire to crank out top reviews.",2,0,1,0

We started off the course with the seafood tower made for 1-3 people, it was amazing and the sauces that came with them were exquisite. For dinner we got the under the sea and the lobster ravioli. Both were amazing and incredibly flavorful. The dessert was what topped it off, a honey blueberry eclair and their homemade ice cream and sorbets.

"Russ H.","8/31/2015","Falls Church, VA","The food was great, but the service was pretty bad.  First of all, the waitress was really forgetful--it was about after sitting there for fifteen minutes did the waitress take our drink order, which I had to remind her to do after she took our food orders.So, the food.  Had the seafood gazpacho for an appeteizer, which was excellent, and my wife and I each decided to go for a half course of pasta prior to a ""simply grilled"" fish entree.  When trying to order the pasta, the waitress did a terrible job of selling the lobster ravioli--when my wife asked how big the portion was, the waitress said you get two ravioli and maybe a claw.  Realistically, the ravioli were huge (dumpling size) and it was a lot of food--waitress could have done a better job describing it.  My wife and I both ordered swordfish since it was fresh that day, my swordfish came out great but my wife's was significantly undercooked.  They gave us free dessert (which was great) to make up for it, which was nice. Probably won't go back there spending my own money.  Spent about the same amount at Patowmack Farm recently and felt much more special.",3,0,0,0
"Katie L.","9/1/2015","Vienna, VA","I really love Fiola Mare. The food here is incredible and the service, ambiance, crowd, and location are unparalleled. I give it five stars because I truly had an incredible meal and lovely time. The service was great - just the right pace and right amount of attentiveness. Although we had reservations and it took them a bit of time to seat us, the hostess really made an effort to accommodate our large group despite how busy they were. It was understandable that some patrons decided to linger because it was after all a lovely summer evening when we dined. Our server was very cordial and paid attention to our individual needs despite being a large group of 9. Location wise, I understand why Fiola Mare is a hot spot. It's right in front of the Georgetown waterfront and you get the most breathtaking views, even at night. The interior is classy; gorgeous inside but still rustic, warm and inviting. Truly a cool restaurant space. As for the food, it was such a delightful meal. My friends seemed to be in agreement about how delectable their own orders were. What I got to try were the lobster ravioli, under the sea, and donuts. All were flavorful and satisfying; cooked perfectly. The foie gras on Under the Sea was incredible and the entire dish was just a seafood delight, yummy to nth power.This was my first time going, but I am certain I'll be back for so much more. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! DC is very lucky to have Fiola Mare!",5,5,1,2
"Christiane V.","9/4/2015","Vienna, VA","i dined at fiola mare with some friends after hearing so many wonderful things about the restaurant. there aren't a ton of restaurants in georgetown that stand out to me so i was pleasantly surprised! it is located right on the waterfront.they were able to accomodate our larger party on a week night. we had to wait a little bit at the bar but that was ok because my husband really enjoyed their old fashioned. he said it was one of the best he's had!our server was average. he didn't go above and beyond but he was very knowledgeable regarding everything on the menu.the food was excellent. the menu is (obviously) mostly seafood. i am on a burrata kick so i ordered the burrata salad with tomatoes, peaches, and figs. it was amazing. so light and fresh. i had the bucatini for my main plate. if there is ever a bucatini on the menu, i will order it. the pasta was cooked just how i like it, al dente. we finished off with the donuts as recommended by our server. those were really decadent.i love how they offer half portions of their pasta. it is nice if you want to order multiple things but not fill up on pasta. it is also great because they have a lobster ravioli that is $50. eating pasta as an app is sooooo italian :)overall a really great restaurant. it is just really expensive!",4,1,0,1
"Paola A.","9/5/2015","Washington, DC","Wow. Blown away. Everything that I tried here was absolutely incredible. The seafood was prepared simply, so the quality of the food (prawns, lobster, langoustine, clams, mussels, fish) really stood out. The tuna tartare was so awesome- the avocado cream on it was so delicate and delicious! The lobster ravioli was sweet and savory and so flavorful- the chunks of lobster were so satisfying against the slippery texture of the house-made ravioli/pasta. And the Waygu beef... OMG talk about melt-in-your-mouth!!We were lucky enough to try a bunch of desserts, but my favorite was the bomboloni with caramel/butterscotch sauce. I could bathe in that sauce.The service was incredible- everyone we interacted with was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and accommodating.

"Cassie D.","9/7/2015","Tampa, FL","Exceptional. One of the best meal experiences I have had in a long time. Came here with a few girlfriends for Sunday brunch and were highly impressed. The manager as well as kitchen manager came out to check on us in person, the server was happy to make suggestions and immediately knew when you needed something without us having to ask. We did the unlimited drink brunch option and it was certainly a lot of food! We were sad to not be able to finish all of it. The salads were by far the stars of lunch with fresh burrata that tasted as if they just made it! The pasta and eggs Benedict were also to die for. We were starving when we first sat down and made the mistake of eating way to much of the warm pastry basket. Whilst it was delicious, the lemon ricotta pancakes we couldn't finish at the end definitely would have been worth more tummy space! Gorgeous views, delicious food and exceptional staff.

"Cassidy L.","9/12/2015","Orlando, FL","The Bucatoni pasta is TO DIE FOR. I legitimately wanted to lick the plate clean.

Thankfully, Fiola Mare offers gluten-free pasta imported from Italy for those guests with allergies/sensitivities. The Bucatoni is a pasta seafood dish featuring mussels and alaskan king crab. The sauce is rich and absolutely delectable.

"Vivi N.","9/14/2015","Lanham, MD","4.5 starsMy sister and I took our Mom here to celebrate her birthday. We all decided to try their Signature Brunch which is $48/person. It entails bottomless cocktails (mimosas, bellinis, or mocktails) or coffee service, a warm pastry basket, and choice of a 3 course meal from the list of options on the menu. Here's what I got:Salad - Smoked Salmon Piadina. So freakin' good. Granted, I removed the heirloom tomatoes but doing so didn't, like, effect the taste or anything. Also, the salad was heaped on top of a large pita bread which was a nice surprise.Pasta - Bucatini alla Carbonara. Simply delicious but kind of small. The sunny-side up duck egg was larger than the pasta portion. Dessert - Bomboloni. The ricotta doughnuts were so tasty on its own that I didn't need to cover it with the salted caramel fudge sauce.The reason for the 4.5 was because of the Brunch Favorites menu. I felt that more could've been added for variety. None of the options impressed me enough to try hence why I got pasta instead. My Mom did get the Occhio di Bue. The sunny-side up eggs were huge (again)  while there were a good amount of mussels on her plate. She was slightly disappointed about the grilled bread - they were small; not enough.This is my second time at Fiola but first time trying their brunch. Both of my visits left me very much impressed.",4,0,0,0

"Ben T.","9/22/2015","Dunwoody, GA","Wow what a special meal. I came here on a Sunday night with friends for dinner and drinks. Fiola Mare is located on the Potomac River in Georgetown just down from the Kennedy Center on the waterfront near other adjoining restaurants and boardwalk. The restaurant will provide valet car service which cost about 14 dollars upfront. There are some close parking garages which could also be an option. We obtained reservations a few weeks early and were verified by phone 48 hours in advance. It is important to note that cancellations within 24 hours are possibly subject to a 50 dollar ""no show fee"". I have learned these policies are usually in place and reserved mostly for establishments that take their product very seriously. Upon entering I was greeted with a beautiful restaurant space. The bar, dining room and patio are all pleasing and enjoyable to be within.  Outside is equally pleasant given the water proximity and views of Roosevelt Island and DC.  The star of the show here however is focused inward toward food and service. Our dinner began with cocktails and proceeded slowly and purposefully through a meal with many highlights. Your table will be gifted with basically a leather bound alcohol book. Even the most seasoned drinker may be overwhelmed but one of three sommeliers will be more than eager to help. Help is a theme that ran through our time at Fiola Mare as our table was visited by no less than 6 different employees all dressed properly for the occasion. This menu is not limited to wine but most impressively list their gins, bourbon and even grappa! It would help to have a plan before sitting as to how you plan to enjoy this part of the experience. Most of the drinks were prepared table side which was a novelty I had not anticipated but enjoyed thoroughly. As already stated but expected the wine list is vast and could easily become overly indulgent financially personally but remarkable to others. The menu is small in quantity but cascades properly in order as an immensity of ingredients follow every listing. This was my first time enjoying authentic Italian seafood but and was eager to taste flavors that included but not limited to: squid ink, sea urchin and salmon roe.  There is also a section for fresh whole fish which can be ordered as a filet or prepared table side. I decided to go with a filet and half order of pasta with small samplings from the entire table as everything was too good to not share and compete for who won best choice. All the items had a faint omnipresence of the ocean and this fresh, briny marine flavor permeated and pleased the palate. Our last course was topped off in true Italian style with coffee inspired desserts. I rarely finish with sweets but vanilla gelato with pour over espresso was too necessary and tempting to say no. The sweetness opposed the saltiness of the meal and the caffeine served as a tool in ensuring an alert ride home. This was a wonderful meal to say the least. Thanks and can't wait until next time!",5,2,1,1

"Paul K.","10/27/2015","Annandale, VA","To be fair, I and my wife came here for brunch and not their dinner service. That being said, what I paid for and what I experienced didn't quite match up. The restaurant itself is very nice, it's located in prime real estate, and the staff are very friendly; however, the food is wanting. We both had the brunch package for approximately $48 per person. The basket of warm pastry and breads was pretty tasty; nothing special, but good nonetheless. The antipasti was their burrata of buffalo mozzarella and it was very tasty. This left me excited for the main course, the Uova in Camicia - poached eggs with prosciutto over homemade biscuits. It was OKAY at best, but everything was way too rich and it kind of left me feeling a bit queasy after the meal. My wife had their little neck clam spaghetti. This was WAY too salty and she honestly couldn't finish it.To avoid sounding like a pretentious jerk, I'll say that the Italian cuisine here was decent at best. I know it's tough to compare to food in Italy, but I'm just not sure that it was supposed to be super rich and/or super salty.Again, this restaurant is nice, the brunch was enjoyable, but I'm giving 3 stars because I didn't see the value of paying $48 per person for the experience we had.",3,0,0,0

"Rob S.","11/1/2015","Tempe, AZ","Fiola Mare is truly a fruits of the sea Italian restaurant.  Weekend brunch starts at 1130 on the Georgetown waterfront on K street.  You start with bottomless cocktails of mimosa, Bellini, or sangria.  I chose Sangria, which is a great choice.  The waiter was great in responsiveness wig water and refills.   The first course is the read basket, delightfully filled with warm breads and croissants.   The variety is sure to please all the bread lovers at the table.  Second course is pasta or breakfast delights.  I chose the pasta with king crab, used to b clams, but totally nice red sauced pasta dish.  Finish with bomb oil, Italian donuts with an orange Carmel sauce for dipping.  Pretty amazing feast with plenty of liquid libations.  Great ambiance, company and food.  This is a must go to place!!!!",5,0,0,0

"Karen X.","11/1/2015","New York, NY","I had their 1. lobster with ravioli (waiter highly recommended) 2. grilled salmon 3. A cinnamon doughnut dessert (forgot the name, waiter recommended)They were all perfectly done and super tasty. I am not a big fan of ravioli (and most kinds of pasta), doughnut ( and almost all kinds of dough based stuff), and all kinds of cinnamon flavor anything. However, all thing I hated was super delicious here. Nothing is over done. Great Service. We kept getting small complimentary desserts while we were there. Waiter didn't talk to us much, but was super helpful and nice (hate those waiters who keep talking to you, thinking they might get more tips!!!???)A must-try",5,0,0,0
"Margaret W.","11/2/2015","Washington, DC","My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday. It was the first I've ever heard of Fiola Mare. I had come early, and they sat me outside on a picturesque Friday night. The server was incredible, attentive and thoughtful as he kept mentioning my birthday. My boyfriend and I started with the Frutti di Mare. It was amazing. Anyone who loves seafood should have a taste. My favorite of the many choices you had on this plate was the octopus and the truffle flavored fluke sashimi. We almost ordered too much food, but the server was kind enough to warn us when we asked of how much food we were ordering for two. Our entree was a shared Truffle Short Rib pasta, which was to die for. I had to have dessert, but my boyfriend was hesitant, already stuffed from the meal. I ordered the Crostata di Pera. They crack and serve the pie in front of you on what looks to be a short stump of a tree. There are ladies in full gowns and men in suits. This is a location where the elite wine and dine. If you want to go somewhere stylish, delicious and slightly pretentious, Fiola Mare is the place to go.",5,1,1,1
"Geena K.","11/2/2015","New York, NY","I came here for my birthday, and was very excited after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, the service and the food was sub par. However, I can understand why so many people may enjoy the food here. I live in New York, and New Yorkers just do Italian better, so for that reason, I am giving them an extra star. The service was the most disappointing thing of the night. I would expect better service from a restaurant of that caliber. Maybe I am mistaken by the level of dining at this restaurant, but the night did not start off right as the server got my father's drink order wrong twice and also sent over the wrong wine for me. After that I knew what to expect from the service. We started with the Fiola Mare Oysters and Caviar. The disappointing factor in this dish was that the Prosecco Zabaglione had some sort of seasoning in it that completely masked the briny deliciousness an oyster naturally has. We then ordered grilled langoustines. Sadly, they were overcooked. We ordered a couple other appetizers, but I do not remember what they were.Then to the entrees. We had the Frutti di Mare, Bucatini with Red King Prawns and Sea Urchin, Under the Sea, the Grilled Monk Fish, and something my sister ordered that is now obviously forgettable. I've had better frutti di mare for half the price at a trattoria or made by yours truly at home. The seafood medley was average, as well as the monk fish. As stated previously, I don't even have a clue what my sister's dish tasted like. The bucatini was definitely the best entree, but with flavors of the king prawns in the uni sauce, it would be a dish hard to mess up.The saving grace for the dinner was the dessert (another extra star). We ordered the Bomboloni,  Marchesi, lemon tart, and a birthday cake. The bomboloni were so fluffy; true comfort food. The marchesi was so smooth and chocolately and paired very well with the pistachios and mint. The lemon tart was perfectly balanced, and the cake (not on the menu) was very moist and delicious.I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, we can't have everything we want.",3,2,1,0
"Alison K.","11/3/2015","Lewes, DE","Found this place by a Google search. How lucky we were! Didn't make reservations so we were offered bar or bar tables. We sat at the bar and had a wonderful experience. Bartender/server Readieon (I'm guessing how he spells his name Ready-N) was awesome! Recommend everything and it was all fabulous. My husband and I split the lobster ravioli...omg so freaking good and a must eat. Then we split four ounces of the wagyu beef...it's expensive but so worth it! The beef just melts in your mouth, nothing like you have ever had before. The recommendations for wine pairing was just as good. Can't say enough good things about this place.

"Asli D.","11/8/2015","Philadelphia, PA","I think the only reason people love to rave about this place is to say that they've been to the oh so well known Fiola Mare. I'm not saying the food is bad - but for these prices...these absolutely ludicrous prices...it is not. worth it. Nothing was exceptionally good. We received pasta we had to send back because it was way too salty and another that had dry and stuck together noodles. For the prices and reputation of this restaurant, these things should not be issues. Also - the waiters hover like crazy. I love attentive service but oh my gosh they breathe down your neck there..I felt like I couldn't have one private conversation.  It's sad that these waterfront restaurants know that they don't need to put out great food anymore and can still overcharge.

The ambiance is warm, romantic and had enough of a ""scene"" to make for great people watching. The ""oysters and caviar"" appetizer was perfection. -a tall shot glass of clean ""not too fishy"" oysters topped with a foam (I forget what exactly it was) that was very flavorful and created a delicate balance. Aside the oyster glass was a cracker topped with wonderfully salty caviar that was the perfect texture and compliment to the oysters. The lobster ravioli was on point and right up there with The Ivy, the tuna carpaccio was extraordinary and the branzino was delightful. Service was awesome, wine list is mind blowing.

"Jennifer H.","11/15/2015","Peoria, AZ","After attending a weekend of wedding events, my friends and I decided to end our vacation with a nice dinner by the river. It was a no brainer coming to Fiola Mare, which was so highly recommended by our friends who live in or at least frequent D.C. Apparently the menu changes often, but a few favorites remain staples of the restaurant. The Tuna carpaccio appetizer is one of them, as well as the award winning Under the Sea entreé which features of sampler of what the ""sea has to offer"" that includes Branzino, lobster, uni, langoustine, scallops, mussels, fois gras on top of quinoa. The large red prawn bucatini pasta was really good, but not always on the menu. My husband and I shared a whole Spanish Turbot, which is seasonal and imported from the Mediterranean. It's hard to describe the taste but it was delicate yet rich in texture. It wasn't a problem for the two of us to quickly devour this unique flatfish. He and I also ordered a salmon tartare type appetizer which we enjoyed even more than the ahi tuna carpaccio. Perhaps, this was because there was truffle slices topping the raw salmon which is a combination that we are partial to! There can never be enough truffles! Between the numerous bottles of wine, appetizers, entrees, and desserts, it didn't take long for the four of us to end up with a meal equivalent to purchasing.. Oh well we won't go there. There's a reason Fiola Mare is so popular...maybe, several reasons). Renowned dishes, impeccable service, and lively-sophisticated atmosphere are all obvious factors that keep people wanting more. We did enjoy quite the memorable night.",4,2,1,3
"maryam p.","11/20/2015","Columbus, OH","birthday dinner was here, and it could not have been better! in the vein, it was very cute that they had a little birthday card waiting for me, and the yummy desert treat at the end. so birthday stuff aside, the service and the food were exceptional, and being right along the water in georgetown adds to the atmosphere. servers were knowledgeable and friendly, and since we noted we would be sharing various items, they even divided it all up for us (while still presenting the food beautifully). We ordered the tuna tartare (my favorite and one of the best I've ever had, with lots of great flavors) the lobster ravioli (one of the items they are known for-lots of tender lobster meat) and the grilled calamari (much more subtle flavors, but as its under the 'simply grilled' section, thats to be expected). Way too much food for 2 people! Next time I'd stick to just the tuna tartare and the lobster ravioli, as they were real standouts, especially compared to much of DC's seafood scene. Would highly recommend this spot for a special occasion!",5,0,0,0

"Lu D.","11/30/2015","Washington, DC","Fiola Mare will go down as our best meal of 2015. Hands Down. This proclamation is not made without heavy consideration. The wifey and I have had the good blessing to enjoy the city's best restaurants, including Minibar. I did have a heavy heart when reading reviews below from diners that had anything but an outstanding meal; wishing that they had the same experience we did.The moment you enter Fiola Mare, you're transported to an otherly world. A host whisks your jackets and you are sat down amidst a room full of diners, lost in their meals and conversation. Our server showered us with attentiveness, taking the time to describe the nuances of dishes; what we may prefer based on preferences shared and gently steering us in a direction he best saw fit with our input.Please do yourself a favor and order the grilled wild calamari as an appetizer. This one dish took my breath away. I was immediately transported to the Mediterranean. With light grill marks, the freshness of the calamari was accentuated by a drizzle of lemon. I savored each bite.The Fiola Maine lobster ravioli was outstanding. Rich yet light, with the nuggets of stuffed lobster. The pasta with King Prawn was savored, each bite meltingly soft. The Under the Sea dish with branzino, lobster, sea urchin, langoustine, and much more exemplified how the best of ingredients prepared simply in a complex, light, and aromatic dashi could shine on its own without unnecessary alterations. Wifts of the sea with each bite, indeed.",5,5,0,1
"Steve S.","12/3/2015","Arlington, VA","Based on price and aspiration, ***.  Was here for a private event for about 20.  Instead of having a dedicated bar stand, the server ran drink orders 2 and 3 at a time to the bar and back.  Not at all efficient.  The menu had options to circle.  Rather than have people select during happy hour, so food could start coming when we sat down, it was one or two servers coming to each guest.  A long process. Our first course did not show up for an hour and 15 minutes or so.The seafood tower, was across the board, awesome tasting fresh with pretty much everything you'd expect.  But i found the prepared food overly rich and creamy and the flavor profile of the food pleasant but not exciting.I understand this was a set menu, and dining for 2 or 4 may be a different experience, but this was not a low budget event, closer to the opposite.If someone else was paying i'd return for the seafood tower, but not anything else.",3,1,0,0

"Chris P.","12/19/2015","New York, NY","Yes.But since you probably want more of a review than just that . . . . My wife and I came here for a celebration dinner. The setting is beautiful, with the restaurant nestled on the Potomac. The interior was reasonably, but not offensively, dark, and the colour scheme was bathed in browns, beiges, and greys. The light fixtures are fantastic. Unfortunately, they didn't come with the meal, and I'd probably shock myself anyway if I tried to install them.Service was sharp, helpful, and knowledgable, yet unobtrusive.We started with a dozen oysters, half-and-half. While there were three different varieties of oysters on the menu, our dozen only came with two. Unfortunately, I can't tell you which ones we ended up devouring, but I can assure you that we devoured them.We also ordered a bottle of white wine. The sommelier was quite knowledgable, and after narrowing down our preferences, we ended up with a fantastic bottle (which, unfortunately, I can't remember, to my wife's dismay). Next, my wife ordered an appetizer-sized portion of the risotto with alba white truffles. That actually isn't correct: My wife ordered an appetizer-sized portion of alba white truffles that happened to be seated on a bed of risotto. They were truffles. They were delicious. Generally, those two things go hand-in-hand, don't they?For our main course, we shared a black bass, which was carved at the table. I'm not sure what kind of voodoo magicks they put in that fish, because it was truly magical. I'm afraid they had to slaughter some virgins in the back to make it that magical. No, seriously, it was tremendous. Brined in something--maybe fairy dust--rubbed with olive oil, rosemary, and some other herbs, and superbly grilled. The only comparable fish I've had is the John Dorry at Populaire Saveur de Poisson in Tangier, which might be the best fish prepared on this planet.Afterward, I was parched, so the obvious solution was Armagnac. I chose the Castarede Reserve de la Famille flight, which included 1985, 1975, and 1965 vintages. The difference in palate and feel among each was quite notable. My favourite was the 1975, but you'll have to try them yourself. For dessert, we had a chocolate dessert that doesn't appear to be on the most recent menu. It was a lovely flourless chocolate torte-like cake, with other fantastic things. I apologize, we were too busy devouring it to note what all was in it.So yes, you should come here. And, as soon as you can.",5,0,0,0
"John A.","12/23/2015","Upper Marlboro, MD","Yelpers had it right with this rating...this place is a solid 4 out of 5. I made reservations using open table and they did make me put a cc on file because it was a weekend reservation, if your prepared to honor the reservation don't be alarmed. My reservation was at 5:45pm, when I arrived the place was already at 80% capacity and they opened at 5pm. Just a heads up, if you're trying to get a view of the water you might want to make your reservation at 5pm exactly. My server was Vince, very knowledgeable on the menu and gave us just the perfect amount of time to ponder the menu, ask questions, and then ultimately change our sections lol. We ordered the mix grilled seafood for (2), side spinach, and a few cocktails. I was kinda disappointed that they weren't serving potatoes that day but it's cool because everything came out super fast and the food was amazing. Can't remember the name but they do have this Madagascar Shrimp/Lobster creature that was pretty cool. It starts with an ""L"" and is a must try if you ask me. As a preference of mine I prefer to sit as close to the kitchen as possible especially when it's a open kitchen and you can really see how this well oil machine operates. I even saw the head chef who was just as hands on as everyone else in the kitchen. I didn't valet park as the lot is right next door to the restaurant.

"Samantha L.","12/24/2015","Rockville, MD","Fiola Mare is a fine dining restaurant that serves an Italian Seafood fare. The restaurant had a white painted shelf with sea related decor such as knotted vases. Each table has a candle, giving the restaurant an initiate and romantic setting. It seems like a great place for a celebration of any kind.After a show at the Kennedy Center, we were craving dessert so we hopped in our car and drove to Fiola Mare. This restaurant had a great view of the Georgetown waterfront. For drinks, we got a bottle of still water, a few Apple Ciders and a Hot Chocolate. The Apple Cider consisted of Autumn Spice, Citrus, and Farm Honey. It was delicious but a little on the sweet side. I didn't mind the sweetness but some people may. The Hot Chocolate consisted of grounded milk chocolate blended with hot water and topped with frothy mascarpone cream and Italian chocolate shavings.For desserts, we shared three desserts - Bomboloni, Winter Quince Panna Cotta, and Chocolate Soufflé Crostata, all of which were phenomenal choices. The Bomboloni consisted of six Sardinian Ricotta Doughnuts rolled in Tahitian Vanilla sugar served in a mini deep fryer and served with milk chocolate gelato in a vintage soda fountain dish and with a maple fudge dipping sauce that had a hint of rum. The Winter Quince Panna Cotta consisted of an Italian vanilla custard in a barrel aged maple cream, garnished with winter spice pecans and drops of quince puree, and served with brioche gelato. Since we were a party of five, our server gave us two additional brioche gelato with toasted hazelnut crumble. The Chocolate Soufflé Crostata reminded me of a molten lava tart with a toasted hazelnut crust, filled gianduja (hazelnut based chocolate cream), clementine, raisins, and hazelnut, covered in an creamy Illanka Peruvian Piura Chocolate, baked, and topped with powdered sugar. We liked how it was served hot and fresh from the oven and that it melts in your mouth.",5,5,0,1
"Eric C.","12/29/2015","Baltimore, MD","Amazing birthday present.  My first time dining at Fiola Mare was a treat, and by the time the experience was over, I was already thinking about the next time I would make an appearance.  I will admit, reluctantly, I don't frequent Georgetown much at all; that statement alone might have my Yelp DC card revoked by the ""cool kids"" on this website.  Nonetheless, Fiola Mare might be the go-to spot once the weather gets warm.My lady made reservations (and this is the type of place where you definitely need one) and we were on our way.  Upon arrival, we were greeted like we were royalty; for a minute, I thought it was 1988 and I was the King of Zamunda, minus the rose pedals and African dancing.  I snapped back to reality and made my way to our table.My appetizer was the cream of asparagus soup, was which very good.  For the main course, my lady ordered the Campanelle pasta, while I ordered the swordfish.  My lady felt that the pasta was good, and I would agree based on a couple of bites.  For my first time eating swordfish, I would say that I was mightily impressed with the flavor and overall taste; I would surely recommend if its on the menu.   Also, I would recommend the truffles; the patrons at the table next to ours were raving how good the truffles were.  I heard another table on the way out mention the quality of the truffles as well.I would to give Fiola Mare recognition for acknowledging my birthday with a nice birthday card and a very tasty desert.  All the servers, cooks, and other workers deserve much kudos for how the night went; this was high-quality service from beginning to end.Fiola Mare is on the top of my list of places that I would recommend for a fine dining experience, whether anniversary, birthday, or any other celebration.  There is valet parking, which is $15.  Call the restaurant and ask for more information....or just peep these Yelp reviews :).  Go to FM if you have not already.",5,4,2,2

"Kirk S.","1/10/2016","Washington, DC","Fiola Mare is a solid option and deserves its popularity but perhaps lacks a bit of originality in execution and lacks portion sizes given the price it commands.Fiola Mare is a high-end Italian/Seafood joint on the Georgetown waterfront.  The design is nice and clean but perhaps a bit unsurprising.  Given the difficulty in landing a reservation and the near-nosebleed prices some of the dishes command, this is definitely a place best saved for special dates and occasions.  To that end, the view of the water is absolutely spectacular.  As one would expect, the service and overall speed here is superb.  The menu is pretty broad, but somewhat unsurprising - expect a boatload of pasta, seafood, and pretty much other recipes you've seen at plenty of other places.I had brunch here.  I ordered an Aviation cocktail with an order of their Steak and Eggs - a very simple dish for a simple brunch.  The cocktail was excellently mixed (at the table, no less) and a welcome start to the meal.  The Steak and Eggs was also pretty much perfect - the egg was perfectly cooked, the steak (rare, of course) was an excellent cut, etc. - but perhaps a bit small given the higher price, especially in comparison with similar offerings from other high-end D.C. restaurants.  I hate to be ""that guy"" who complaints about portion sizes at a high-end restaurant, but... it was kinda noticeable.   Other dishes appeared to not suffer quite as much from a portion size issue, thankfully, so I might have just had a strange experience.",4,7,2,5
"Joe R.","1/11/2016","Falls Church, VA","First time dinning here, I decided to get the Fiola Mare Signature Brunch on a slightly foggy Saturday. Reserved a table (highly recommended) next to the window with a view of the Georgetown waterfront. The ambiance inside was very elegant, clean and fitted the ""fine dinning"" atmosphere/vibe. Our brunch started with a choice of bottomless Mimosa, Bellini and Sangria to drink, topped with a very nice assortment of ""Basket of Warm Pastry & Breads"". The petite-sized pastries complemented with butter and jam were a great addition that was included in the Brunch special. We then decided to get the Roasted Butternut Squash Crostone and the Smoked Salmon Piadina for our Antipasti/Salad option. For our Main course, we decided to order the Rigatoni alla Carbonara (description: Guanciale, Black Pepper, Pecorino Romano, Sunny Side-Up Duck Egg) and Spaghetti Gragnano ( description: Littleneck Clams, San Marzano Tomatoes, Parsley, Controne Chilies). Both dishes were very flavorful and distinct in taste. Lastly, we finished with dessert by ordering the Winter Quince Panna Cotta and the Bomboloni.

"Lydia K.","1/15/2016","Seattle, WA","Perhaps, I was expecting too much. Perhaps, my tastebuds are spoiled. I wasn't impressed with their food at all.It seemed like street parkings were mostly full, and I did't want to park on the street because the area seemed a little sketchy. Valet parking costs $16 bucks + tips. Once we walked in, staffs welcomed us, checked in our coats, and led us to our table. A Thursday night, the restaurant seemed pretty booked already. Good thing we made a reservation! Our server was friendly and gave me a whole menu that says ""happy birthday"" to take it home as a complimentary gift. Lol. So far everything is good. I tried to order some sweet cocktail. Unfortunately, they don't serve sweet drinks here. :( so I got Bellagio which contains pomegranates and it was aight.Here comes the food.For two people, we started off with Ahi tuna carpaccio. (Pretty much ordered things that were popular on yelp). The chef was nice enough to split our food into seperate dishes to make it easier for us. When I tried the appetizer, I thought it had too much different flavors in one small dish which was very distracting to taste. I've had better tuna stacks before so appetizer was meh for me.Then we ordered fiola Maine lobster ravioli which i was excited for the most. again, the chef splited food for us. When I tried the ravioli, it tasted good at first. Warm, creamy, again rich in flavor. But the more and more you try with the sauce, you kind of get sick of it fast (perhaps too rich in flavor). The most disappoint thing for me was how tough the lobster was. I had to chew so much to swallow the lobster it was hurting my jaw. :( Hoping that the last dish could redeem my disappointment, I decided to order grand Adriatic grilled seafood. I was excited when I got my food because the presentation seemed very nice. But when I tried the fish, it was too greasy and fishy for me (tasted like super omega-3). Trust me, I am a sucker for sushi so I would normally eat all kind of fish but something about grilled salmon that was too oily.. made me almost gag. And I know it's grilled, but honestly, I felt like I could make it better at home. I didn't even finish half of my dish and had to stop eating. After that the server gave us birthday complimentary sweets and a card which was very nice of them.Service was great through the night except one thing that was bugging me a little was there were a lot of Mexican servers communicating in Mexicans which made me wonder if they are they talking about us. I was a little uncomfortable sitting on the table right next to them talking and thought it was unprofessional speaking non-english loudly to other servers while serving food at the fine dinning restaurant.

First and foremost the service. It was outstanding. Attentive and friendly, with tons of staff, everyone there to make you happy. You really don't get service like that too often anymore. The food was excellent. I had to do the lobster ravioli because you hear so much about it. Decadent and wonderful. The tuna was terrific as well.  Asparagus soup outstanding. Great atmosphere, great view, romantic setting with my beautiful wife. Seriously a great night and I can't wait to go back. Thank you to everyone at Fiola Mare for impressing is so much!",5,0,0,0
"Ariel R.","1/20/2016","Washington, DC","This is truly a fantastic dinning experience. From the moment we were seated we received top notch service.  The waitress explained the menu and dishes and she paid just the perfect amount of attention to us.Food: ordered the bucatini with wild tiger prawns and sea urchin.  The pasta is cooked perfectly and the sea urchin complements the entire dish.  The grilled calamari is fresh and grilled to perfection.  The flavor profile is simple yet spot on.  The ahi tuna carpaccio is a great addition to balance the heavier pasta dishes. Clearly all ingredients are fresh and presented with such care.  The best dish is the Maine Lobster Ravioli.  The butter pouched lobster melts in your mouth.  The lobster pieces are nice in size and generously portioned throughout the dish and the ravioli is stuffed with big chunks of lobster. Drinks: the bartenders make an array of unique classic cocktails with a twist. Ordered the winter tail, foreign policy, and sapore vero. Drinks were all mixed well and served accordingly.  To each his own on drinks, but everything poured is a delight.Price: this is on the finer side of dinning so expect to spend a few dollars.  Whatever the price, it is worth it!Overall, we will definitely return!",5,1,0,0
"Ashley H.","1/29/2016","Herndon, VA","Went for restaurant week and was my first time there. If it weren't for a lunch deal, it probably wouldn't be a place I could afford to easily. It really blew my mind though. Open, bright, classy and nautical theme with big windows overlooking the river. The service is phenomenal, they switch out your forks between meals, keep the water glasses full, and brought me a fresg grapefruit soda even though I didn't order a drink.The food was small, healthful portions you could say. My appetizer was a beet and orange salad with olives. Perfect summer food in the middle of winter. Mix of sweet and salty. Entree was bronzino fillet over farro. Super tender. Dessert was a chocolate-orange panna cotta. I tried my friends' cocktails and they were fabulous and unique..and pretty. You really feel special here and I think it lives up to its reputation as top DC restaurant.",5,1,0,0

"Katie F.","1/30/2016","Washington, DC","We went to Fiola Mare today for lunch/brunch to celebrate my mother's birthday. It is quite a lovely space right on the water in Washington Harbor. The decor is light and airy and is evocative of the sea. They gave us a lovely, quiet table in a separate room. This was my first (and perhaps only) visit to the restaurant. The service was very good. They made my mother feel very special by giving her a birthday card. The maitre'd also greeted her and wished her a very happy birthday on her way out. Unfortunately, the food was marginal, at best. I have gluten sensitivity and was pleased to see that they had gluten-free pasta on their menu. I ordered a kale pesto with mussels dish. Unfortunately, it was EXTREMELY salty! At first, I found the taste somewhat pleasant, but it just became overwhelming. My husband ordered shrimp and grits. His major complaint was that it was so hard and messy to eat. Every shrimp had to be peeled and they were in a deep dish that was not user-friendly. They gave me a bowl for my mussel shells, but gave him nothing in which to place his shrimp shells. My five-year-old ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. They came with creme fraiche, but no syrup. The waiter asked if she could have bourbon maple syrup. I said, ""Don't you just have plain maple syrup?"" He said they did not. How did they make the bourbon maple syrup if they didn't have maple syrup to begin with? Odd. My mother and her friend both seemed to enjoy their meals, but I don't think it was worth the price. Overall, the ambiance and service are good, but the food is so-so.",3,0,0,0
"Julia G.","1/31/2016","Silver Spring, MD","Five stars. Hands down, the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to. Everyone was very courteous , helpful, and pleasant. Our server was excellent , knowledgeable and prompt. We sampled some wine before deciding On the super Tuscan. It paired  nicely with the meal. Nice aroma and juust sweet enough . For starters we ordered the fiola mare oysters and caviar. It was a new dish to me so it was a pleasant surprise. It was sweet but tangy. The oysters tasted fresh . I liked the creamy sauce with sprinkle of caviar on top. It was all contained in a flute. It was new. It was interesting. Looked forward to my entree. I ordered the bucatini which was the most amazing pasta dish I've ever had in any restaurants. I usually don't like going to Italian restaurants only because most of the pasta dishes are what I can make at home. Nothing to it. But this pasta dish blew my expectations. It had all the right flavored and definitely not a dish you can make at home. It had hints of Sea urchin and prawn which just topped it. My boyfriend ordered the duck egg ravioli with black truffles. I love truffles. It takes any pasta to the next level. He loved his dish as well. Next onto the dessert. I had the homemade gelato ice cream. It was simply delicious. Smooth and creamy. The nougat was my favorite. The vanilla flavored gelato following closely behind. The only thing I would change is maybe instead of the pistachio gelato I'll try the coconut sorbet. My boyfriend had the donuts. For donuts it was pretty good. He enjoyed it more with the macchiato. The presentation for all the dishes are spot on. Overall a splendid dinner, one that I enjoyed fairly and would probably go back again.",5,1,0,0
"Maris K.","1/31/2016","Westford, MA","This may seem like common sense, as Fiola Mare is a seafood restaurant, but it is important to note that there are virtually no options for non-seafood eaters. I am not exaggerating. If you're going with a party whose food tastes you don't know, beware: options may be limited. That said, the staff was very friendly and easily accommodating of a vegan in our group. I myself am very picky about seafood--if anything tastes ""fishy,"" I am out--but found everything here to be incredibly delicious. (So as not to lose credibility as a reviewer of a seafood restaurant, please note that I ate oysters, scallops, fish, and lobster over the course of the evening.)Tips: Great date spot if you have the money to spend (it is easy to drop $40+ on an entree alone). The volume level was lively but not deafening, and the view lovely, even while the river view windows were closed up for the season. You can get some pretty fancy appetizers, but consider the oysters if you're going to get one of the more complex entree options (you'll know what I mean when you read the menu). The oysters come with two incredibly unique sauces (at time of writing, fruit-based and shallot-based sauces) that were like nothing I've ever eaten. Don't skip dessert. Get the doughnuts.",4,1,0,0
"Will N.","2/1/2016","Fairfax, VA","This is my favorite restaurant at waterfront. The place looks great, is in a perfect location, has amazing food, and impeccable service. Make sure you get reservations ahead of time because they book up fast. I arrived a little early for my reservation on Friday night, so I had had a couple drinks at the bar beforehand. Bartender was super professional and fast. After we were seated, the server was extremely polite and helpful, gave great recommendations, and was very attentive. We wanted to split the two entrees and our server said it was no problem and had them split in the kitchen and plated separately. The lobster ravioli was out of control. It was just as good as it sounded. Big chunks of lobster. I wish I could remember the second item, it was fish with truffles and WOW. Unbelievable. We didn't want desert but the server ended up giving us complimentary apricot ice cream/gelato which was also fantastic. All in all, great experience. It's pricey but worth it.",5,1,0,0

"Hannah H.","2/2/2016","VA, VA","NOPE.About a 1-1.5:  I've been wanting to try out Fiola Mare for a while now, so I was pretty excited to finally come here for dinner with ADRIENNE M.  Set in the Georgetown Waterfront, dining here during the day/spring/fall would be the best time (in the evening, nothing can be seen!).  Owned by Fabio and Maria Trabocchi, the menu offers antipasti, soups, salads, grilled fish, pasta dishes, as well as other seafood entrees.  It's a mix of Italian and Mediterranean cuisine, focusing primarily on fresh seafood.  We started off with the Fiola Mare Oysters & Caviar (with Chef Creek oysters, prosecco Zabaglione, chives, pane carasau, and Grinnel caviar, this came in a little test tube-like glass vessel, hanging 'freely' on a rim; there were about 3 oysters that were super briny, and I wasn't a fan of the combination of the flavors, as it was like a carbonated cream-based sauce) and the Japanese Hiramasa Tartare (base of a cauliflower panna cotta, hazelnut oil, passion fruit zabaglione, and paddlefish caviar, chopped hiramasa was fresh, but the bite itself was way too acidic).  For the entrees, I had the Rigatoni (pork cheek ragu, maitake mushrooms, bacon, spinach, and barilotto di bufala; this was my least favorite dish of the night, as the pork ragu was just not tasty at all - it wasn't seasoned, in addition it to having a very soft texture; also, it had an off 'pork' taste to it, and the watery tomato ragu sauce was not appetizing); the Buccatini (some langoustine tails, espelette, basil, hay-smoked sea urchin, and almond pane fritto; the sea urchin was miniscule, and there were hardly any on the plate; the langoustine tails were a bit overcooked, so they had a slight rubbery bite to them; I found this dish to have a very distinct 'hot dog' taste to it, that was a little off-putting!); and, the Fiola Maine Lobster Ravioli (little purses filled with lobster, with also an addition of extra lobster meat on the side, this had way too much ginger and seemed to ruin the taste; I appreciated the creamy sauce with the abundance of chopped chives; however, the ginger was just way too overpowering) - I loved that all the pasta were cooked perfectly al dente, and had a lovely slight bite to each of them.  We shared a grilled Dover Sole (a whole fish that is deboned and carved tableside, the fish was very delicate and soft, but could have used a bit more seasoning; while the sole was light and buttery, I wished there was some type of a sauce that came with besides the sliced lemon and the salsa verde).  We also had a side of the Wilted Spinach alla Romana (with garlic, pine nuts, and golden raisins, this was way too salty; I can handle salt, but this had just copious amounts of it!) and a Risotto with some mushrooms (this was my favorite of the night, as the risotto was cooked perfectly - it was buttery, seasoned perfectly, and the mushrooms were lovely).  For dessert, I tried their milk chocolate gelato (this was not overly sweet, but tasted more like a malt chocolate shake; it was delicate in flavor and it was yummy), a delicious raspberry sorbetto (nice and tangy), a piece of their complimentary chocolate/hazelnut cake (this was pretty delicious, as it had a nice little toasted crunch base with buttercream and hard milk chocolate pieces), and a Bomboloni to-go (our server, Douglas (who was very friendly, kind, and efficient), was able to custom-make the flavors for us, and I had a slip of mind and forgot to take it with me; I was a little upset that they threw the bombolonis out as they turned-over our table so quickly (still, my fault) T____T When the management (Juan) was notified, he took the liberty to choose a flavor, and then proceeded to pass the blame onto our server and to my dining counterpart (which is so not cool). I was just not a fan of the overall taste of each of the dishes. The food itself was, honestly, pretty underwhelming, considering that Fiola Mare consistently ranks as one of the top restaurants in the DC area.  With the odd combination of flavors, the overcooked seafood, and the lack of communication of the management on staff that evening, I can't recommend this place.+#overhyped+overcooked seafood T____T+risotto with mushrooms :D+ask for Douglas and Carlos :D+not-so-nice management T____T+extremely limited metered parking off of K St; valet available",2,18,11,12

However, the pastas are heavenly indulgences not to be missed. If you're looking for lighter fare, the seafood is always perfectly cooked and the salads fresh and beautifully presented. I've enjoyed lunch in the dining room as well, and the service has always stood out as incredibly gracious and attentive. With its location on the waterfront, it's a great place to take a date or business associate you'd like to impress.

Everything was fab - the food, the service, the gorgeous view of the Potomac.  Everything was delicious, and it was restaurant week for lunch to boot.  We had divine butternut squash soup, Bronzino with farro and the most delicious, rich little chocolate dessert ever that won over two serious chocoholics.I took my friend for her birthday and Fiola Mare couldn't have been nicer - the hostess wished her happy birthday when we arrived, the waiter did as well.  He even brought an extra dessert with a candle as a surprise, along with a nice birthday card from the owners.  Everyone was gracious and the service was perfection.  I'm pretty sure diners are always treated to such attentive service.There are several well priced menus that give you a few options to eat here even when it's not restaurant week without blowing a hole in your budget - check the website.  Thanks for the beautiful lunch, Fiola Mare!   I'll be back.",5,2,0,1
"Carolyn L.","2/7/2016","Winston-Salem, NC","We went here for an amazing lunch yesterday. Everything was absolutely spectacular, the food, the service, the atmosphere, the view, all were equally remarkable. I'm so glad I don't live in DC cause I would probably go broke due to the seafood charcuterie board!We started with the board and the grilled calamari, which our friends have been raving about for days. I was really quite skeptical, as how good can grilled calimari be?! Well, it can be perfect, simply dressed in olive oil and herbs. I will be thinking about that dish for quite some time.For lunch I got the lobster roll, which was very tasty, but not the most memorable dish on the table. The husband's pasta dish was among the most flavorful as I have experienced. He got the cavatelli with king crab, artichokes, and mushrooms. It was super delicious. I would gladly order either again, but his dish was definitely the tastier of the 2.The service was just as spectacular as the food, very attentive and thoughtful. My husband drank about 15 unsweet teas with lunch, each was replaced seconds after being drained, each with a new straw and skewered lemon wedge. The sommelier also selected a delicious bottle of wine which paired exquisitely with all the food at our table.What a lunch! Can't wait to go back when it is a bit warmer to enjoy the outdoor patio and of course another charcuterie board!",5,2,0,0

Tuna Tartare appetizer was uniquely fascinating. Smoked Gnocchi with Langoustine was bar none the most flavorful lobster related dish I've EVER had and I'm from New England. The Brodetto was beautifully rustic. Simply Grilled Calamari was surprisingly delicious and perfectly cooked. For my birthday they brought this incredible chocolate hazelnut layer cake thing with an airy middle layer that kept the dish from being heavy. They also brought a card thanking me for celebrating my birthday with them, which was very classy.

Although expensive, it was absolutely worth every penny.  We were seated in the back dining room and had a lovely and very attentive server. He was honest with what dishes we should try and extremely personable. Now on to the food. We started with oysters and tuna carpaccio.  The oysters were large and fresh. The tuna had a nice citrus addition and unique flavors of basil and roe to compliment it. The squid ink pasta was by far and away one of the best dishes I have ever had. The octopus was tender and the tomato sauce was beyond flavorful. The lobster ravioli was very good and decadent. I enjoyed the ravioli but not the best dish of the night. However, it came with a huge chunk of lobster meet cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth!  For our main course we had Dover sole and scallops. The Dover sole was served with truffles, leeks, and a rich cream sauce. Wow!  As for the scallops, one of the my all time favorite dishes. The carrots, parsnips, sauce and grains all complimented each other and made for the perfect bite.  As for dessert...I am a dessert snob and this did not disappoint what so ever. The bombolini (sugared donuts) with a Carmel/maple sauce will be a dish I will dream about. Top 5 best desserts ever. We also had the chocolate panna cotta that was delicious. It was rich with citrus flavor and a nice crumb coating to add unique texture. I fully believe Fiola Mare lives up to the hype and deserves its rating as one of the top restaurants!  Off to dream about those donuts.",5,1,0,1
"Pegah Y.","2/16/2016","Washington, DC","My fiance and I spent our fourth Valentine's Day together dining at Fiola Mare at the Georgetown Waterfront.  FOURTH!  (As an aside - It sure beats the place we joked about going to on our first Valentine's Day together all those years ago - White Castle!!! Teheheh).  Fiole Mare was rated the #1 restaurant in the DC area by the Washingtonian Magazine this year and neither of us had ever been, so we decided to give it a shot and I decided to treat my fiance and myself to it!  It's conveniently located right on the Georgetown Waterfront and affords some beautiful views of the river.  We walked along the waterfront (it was a delightfully sunny day) before our meal.  The food is SUPERB.  They have an excellent menu for brunch, with your selection of 3 courses for just $48 per person.  They also have bottomless brunch mimosas generally, but they didn't on Valentine's Day.  We still decided to go with their drinks, since they looked so pretty.  I ordered the ""Amore"" cocktail (Rose-infused gin, strawberry syrup, lemon, prosecco) and it was DELICIOUS!  It came with a beautiful flower!  My fiance ordered the more ""masculine"" Moscow Mule (Russian standard vodka, lime juice, ginger beer).  They brought complimentary croissants and bread to our table.  SO DELICIOUS!  They just melted in our mouth and were sensational.For food, we had the choice of an Antipasto (Appetizer), one of either the brunch options or the pasta, and one dessert.  I ordered: -Antipasti: Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella (baby arugula, beets, raspberries, red radishes, basil, manodori balsamic vinegar).  This was great, but I think my fiance ordered better with the ahi tuna tartare! -Pasta: Bucatini alla Granseola (Alaskan King Crab, San Marzano Tomatoes, Parsley, Controne Chiles).  This was good and very delicious, though a bit too salty, and I was already full from all the bread and appetizer!  But I LOVED the portion of king crab and really enjoyed the sauce as well!-Dessert: Winter Quince Panna Cotta (Yogurt Cake, Ricotta Sorbet, Spiced Pecans).  This was good, but I was already very full!  I did enjoy the sorbet! My fiance ordered:-Antipasti: Ahi Tuna Tartare (San Marzano Tomatoes, Meyer Lemon, Taggiasche Olives, Capers).  My fiance ordered very well!  This appetizer came with -Pasta: Rigatoni alla Carbonara (Guanciale, Black Pepper, Pecorino Romano, Sunny Side-up Duck Egg).  My fiance enjoyed this dish a lot, though he said it was a bit too salty as well.-Dessert: Bomboloni (Sardinian Ricotta Donuts, Maple Fudge).  These were donuts.  Again, my fiance ordered very well.  He said the donuts were VERY fresh and fluffy!  Yum!The atmosphere was excellent and we had a view of the waterfront and river from where we were sitting.  The restaurant is light and airy and I loved the decor.The service at our table was good, but we had a LONG wait at the front, despite having reservations.  I guess that's what happens when you eat out on Valentine's Day, though!

"G P.","2/17/2016","Alexandria, VA","My fiancé and I went to fiola mare on a Sunday night for dinner. While there were certain highlights, I would rather splurge this amount of money at a Michelin rated restaurant in nyc. This raved restaurant is ranked 2016's #1 restaurant"" by the Washingtonian??? It lacks the caliber of high end dining and creativity. The only highlights of this meal for us was the service and halibut. Service was attentive and on point. The amuse bouche was not amusing and actually left our palate with an off putting flower petal taste with a watered down truffle. I hate when we are served the house bread that is so stale and tough to eat, our teeth run the risk of cracking.Our appetizers: east coast oysters and the burrata which were decent minus (again) the edible flowers arranged on the burrata. The pasta courses: tiger prawn bucatini and squid ink Campanelle. While the visual aspect of the tiger prawn bucatini was impressive, the bucatini and sauce itself had a spoiled tomato taste with a hint of sulphur. Which was unfortunate, since the prawn itself was cooked correctly. The squid ink Campanelle was moderate but no real complaints. The main entrees: olive oil poached halibut w/ zabaglione sauce and filet of beef over wilted spinach. The olive oil poached halibut was delicious, buttery with a perfect twang from the zabaglione sauce. Desserts: hazelnut tart and chocolate Panna cotta. We had no complaints with the dessert portion, both executed nicely. All in all, I'm glad to have at least tried washingtonian's ""2016 #1""restaurant. Next time, I'd rather take the trip to nyc and spend $$$$ at Marea, le Bernadin, etc for a proper pasta dish or fine dining experience.

"Anna Laura B.","2/17/2016","Washington, DC","My boyfriend and I came here for brunch a few weeks ago. I was eagerly anticipating coming here after Washingtonian magazine named it the best restaurant in DC! Now, one might wonder why a self-professed seafood hater would be excited to go somewhere that serves 99% seafood, their lemon ricotta pancakes and yummy sounding cocktails lured me in.The ambiance of the place is very nice, and the location on the Georgetown Waterfront cannot be beat. Unfortunately we were a little underwhelmed. The service was very good and attentive, but the food was not as great as we expected. My boyfriend's lobster roll had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time and the sauce they had put on it became a bit hard. There was also too much sauce on the lobster roll, they should consider putting the sauce on the side and just lightly saucing it. He did not really enjoy his meal. The lemon ricotta pancakes were very tasty, but they were fairly small and flat, also a little burned. Not very fluffy at all which was disappointing. I understand that this is a high end restaurant and I have no issue paying the price point, but if you are going to charge the amount that Fiola Mare does, I expect better food. The serving sizes are very small and the options for sides are lacking. Also, a $22 bread basket? Really?Drinks were pretty good, but I was disappointed to be leaving hungry after ordering a pancake entree. Fiola Mare was OK but I'll spend my money elsewhere in the future.",3,3,2,2

"Isabelle L.","3/1/2016","Sainte-Feyre, France","We made a reservation at this restaurant last weekend and we really had a good time. The cocktails are a little bit expensive but worth the experience (try a Don Giovanni). We shared a seafood platter between 4 adults and everything on it was delicious. If you're going on the weekend, it's better to make a reservation at least 24h before. Know that they will charge you for a no/show (reservation through open table). Overall we had a good time but I wish they had more tables outside for lunch: the weather was great but we had to sit outside because the 4 tables were reserved.",4,1,0,0

"Joshlen C.","3/4/2016","McLean, VA","We went for brunch on a Saturday and it was wonderful.  TIP! - You have to call in advance and ask to be seated by the waterfront.  The hostess made it clear that we needed to reserve the water view and I gently reminded her that I did.  I am glad that I did call in advance and mention the water view because she was going to stick us in the back of the restaurant.  I am not sure why but, ... That was my only complaint about my experience there.  The brunch was VERY tasty and the bottomless mimosa, bellini or sangria was a great Plus!  I had the Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella salad and my husband had the mussels.  The salad was very tasty but the mussels were amazing.  It was very plump and perfectly made. We both had the pasta - it is the way to go!  YUM!  For dessert, I had the Bombolini (orange zest made it extra yummy and refreshing) and my husband had the Budino Piemontese (it was different than expected but yet very tasty) - we preferred the Bombolini.  It was one of our favorite brunches we had plus the location is a great PLUS!  Great view of the water and people watching.  We will make it our regular places to go for brunch.  Both Fiola restaurants are GREAT!",5,0,0,0

The cocktails were good: Bellagio was refreshing and Don Giovanni had a nice spice. Also enjoyed the oysters (beau solely were my favorite) with the mignonette sauce; wasn't a fan of the pink peppercorn passion fruit sauce though-too sweet. For dinner I enjoyed the Adriatic seafood brodetto, particularly the octopus and shrimp and a great broth. For dessert the bombolini and sauce were delicious as was the hazelnut soufflé. Great service of course and atmosphere. Would love to come back and sit outside - maybe for brunch.",5,0,0,0
"Paul L.","3/17/2016","Alexandria, VA","Phenomenal. Expensive, but this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. Negatives: only one, I felt the tap water smelled a bit of chlorine, so I recommend ordering bottled water. We had a reservation but the restaurant was running about 10 minutes behind. The manager (there were four on the floor) - actually two of them - where extremely attentive, asked what time our reservation was for and when he found out we'd be kept waiting a few (~5 minutes) past, he immediately brought us two glasses of champagne... I happily took mine, but as my wife is pregnant we declined the one for her - so he turned around and got her a mocktail instead. Back on the water, when the manager (different manager) came by, I mentioned the water, he apologized, chatted with us briefly and then brought us a bottle of water - on the house. Anyway, long story short, the food was phenomenal, we shared the ahi tuna appetizer - which they split in the kitchen for us. Main courses were brenzino and capelleti. Dessert was the bomboloni. Food was terrific, wait staff, bus staff and managers were all very professional and very attentive. Coming here to eat is a no brainier - take a look at the menu, if you want to eat well and be treated well - and you can afford the price, I absolutely recommend.

We loved it so much, we ended up eating there two of the four nights. The seafood tower was super fresh and offered a great variety. The salmon sashimi crudo was delicious as well. I got the mixed seafood grill both nights (outstanding if you're wanting variety), my boyfriend said the seabass was delicious and that the halibut was the best he had ever had. A couple of our DC friends say the lobster ravioli is to die for. The bomboloni is a hit, but, the chocolate souffle is out of this world. Wine list is impressive as it is extensive.

Why blah? Let me explain.  We ordered the lobster ravioli as soon as we sat down (because I had my heart set on it and the appetizers didn't look appealing to me).  I knew something was wrong because it came back to the table literally 3-5 minutes later.  I'm NOT joking.  I'm thinking to myself, how the hell can you make ravioli (that's supposed to be fresh) in that time frame.  It made me feel as though it was already made and just heated up.  The food was bland, and for the amount of money I paid ($50 for the ravioli) it wasn't filling AT ALL.  (I ended up going to Chic Fil A afterwards).  The ravioli however was ""decent"".  I expected more coming from a restaurant that had such high reviews.  Cost : $110 (two lobster raviolis)Come Back : HELL NO.",2,4,1,0

However, I have to say that the two highlights from our lunch were, first, the excellent service and second, the dessert. Our server was phenomenal-- a charming young man from North Carolina. He took great care of our table and made the meal a fantastic experience for us. For dessert, we had the fritters with a special sweet sauce (that can only be described as magical, probably because of the Grand Marnier).

"Towhomitmay C.","3/30/2016","Seattle, WA","I found this restaurant by chance while walking the Georgetown-DC waterfront on a Sunday evening. I was dressed for shopping, not dining, and carrying several bags. They treated me like royalty. The food was absolutely fresh, imaginative and stunning. I had ahi carpaccio with Meyer lemon, Marzano tomatoes, Taggiasche olives, yuzu, sorrel cream and trout roe--an amazing, perfectly-balanced-yet-incredibly-intense flavor experience, after which I could have happily retired from eating for life. I didn't retire, as it turns out, because I had the option of ordering only a half-portion of some kind of langoustine-decorated pasta and it too was phenomenal. I blame the two impeccably-matched glasses of wine for my decision to follow up with the bombolini, a/k/a doughnuts made of Sardinian Ricotta with milk chocolate gelato and some kind of warm maple drizzly goodness. As a party of one, I was attended to perfectly, never rushed, and the server even walked me outside under umbrella cover to a cab the restaurant had called at my request. Flawless. Oh, and they have a great view...but your eyes will never leave your plate.",5,1,0,0
"Matthew B.","3/31/2016","Arlington, VA","We made dinner reservations on a Wednesday evening for 8:15 to celebrate our recent engagement. The restaurant has been on our ""special occasions"" list for quite a while. Admittedly, and with no shame, I added that we were celebrating this occasion in the comment section thinking it may score us a small dessert or something. When we arrived (~10 min early) they said they would be able to seat us at our reservation time and to please enjoy the bar area while we wait. Here is where the only glitch happened...a waiter served us water and then never came back to get our drink order. However, that was minor because our table soon came available. If you are looking for a review of food, stop here and go and read about the Fabio Trabocchi's excellence from someone far more qualified. However, definitely get the Lobster Ravioli. The experience my fiancé and I had was first class. As we were seated our waiter brought us two glasses of champagne and a congratulations. As the waiter was pouring my dinner wine he looked at me with a smile and said ""We're celebrating tonight!"" and poured a little extra to top it off. Knowing our spending limits we had decided to just split the appetizer my fiancé had been eyeing. What came out were essentially two orders (my estimation from seeing others around us order it) of the Tuna Carpaccio (delicious) so that we didn't have to split it on one plate. The entire meal was well paced with no hurrying. Table cleaned and reset between courses. The floor manager came over as well to congratulate us and ask about our experience. At the end, we were honestly too stuffed to order dessert, even though we had planned and budgeted to, so we declined. As we awaited our tab the staff reset our table and brought out a congratulatory dessert and a  congratulations/thank you card on a silver platter.From top to bottom, this was a great experience that felt very personal. That is not something you come by in DC often, let alone at one of its loftier scenes.",5,0,0,0

"Alessia R.","4/6/2016","Arlington, VA","Ok so I went to Fiola Mare finally. Yesterday was my 27th birthday and my boyfriend decided to surprise me.  As soon as we arrived I was impressed by the décor and water like theme.  It was very elegant yet comfortable.  When the hostess was walking us to our table, I had mentioned to her if it was possible if we could sit by one of the windows so I could enjoy the view of the Potomac during sunset- but apparently people request that ahead of time- so that was a no go.We were then greeted by our waiter who was Russian. His accent was thick and it was hard for us to understand his descriptions of the menu.  I asked him about some of the specials and he informed me that the menu's were done daily.  One of there overall favorite is the Ahi Tuna Tar-Tar.  The lobster ravioli is also one of their main specials (but has no tie to any authenticity to Italy because they do not make lobster ravioli's there) which is interesting.  We asked for a moment so we could go through the wine lists -because obviously a good meal needs a good bottle of wine.  Once he returned we selected a bottle of red wine and also put in the Ahi Tuna and my bf got the Green Asparagus Milanese.  Before the wine even came while we were enjoying just chit chatting the APATIZERS came.  That was a little frustrating because you want your drinks before your food obviously.  When we told the waiter he said that he was school looking for the wine- not only was there no sense of urgency but it took like and additional 5 minutes for them to locate the wine (which wasn't anything even really crazy) so I'm sitting there staring, waiting to eat my appetizer.  Finally the wine came and we continued on.  The Ahi was amazing.  I can't even deny it.  It was perfect.  My bf's dish was good as well, very fresh and very vibrant.  The second courses came out and I got the GRAGNANO SPAGHETTI CHITARRA which had little clams and a tomato base sauce.  I had asked if the pasta was made fresh daily and he in the beginning said yes, and then when my food was presented he told me that the only one of the menu (which was this one) was not made fresh daily because apparently they import it due to the way that it is dried and made. It was decent well seasoned, but I only got about 6 bottleneck clams and only found about 2 that were actually in the clams.  Not really sure where the rest went because I didn't find any of them in the rest of my pasta.  My boyfriend got the ADRIATIC SEAFOOD BRODETTO which was a combination of different things, clams, prawns, fish, etc in a soup like broth.  Primarily based with a lot of red pepper.  The portions were nice not too over filing for an Italian place where most can feel just like overstuffed. The waiter then asked if we were interested in a desert and I looked over the menu and politely declined. There were nothing on there remotely exciting or traditional to an Italian style dessert.  They had a mini Bombolone on there but I can't get one when I know how they really should taste.  Then awkwardly the waiter came up and asked me if we were celebrating something special...(Uhm yeah obviously) and we acknowledged.  A few minutes later he brought a surprise piece of pastry which was good and a candle and a card from the place.  Overall I felt that there was a pretentious vibe going on, considering that my bf and I were probably the youngest people there on a Tuesday night.  A lot of older and obviously client dinners were going on.  Though the service was ok, and the food was ok... It didn't really matter because I had the best company I could ever ask for.  It truly was the thought  that counted because I really have been begging him to take me there for months now. I may give it another shot- perhaps for the $48 brunch but I'm not sure.I have to thank my amazing boyfriend for dealing with me through this experience and I also have to say he made it the best it could have been.",3,3,0,1

"Yousi F.","4/10/2016","Washington, DC","BELIEVE THE HYPE! I love this place, its always on a ""DC's best restaurant"" list for good reason ( i can't say the same about its sister fiola). Fiola Mare is just exquisite fine dining at its best in a beautiful setting. The ambience is warm, but not stuffy. The staff is attentive and kind and just so thoughtful! I am obsessive about good service and this place has it in spades.Everything is also served so elegantly, there are flower petals in the drinks and lightly resting on ahi tuna carpaccio. Its almost too beautiful to eat. Also, if you let your server know you are sharing something (whether an app or an entree) it will come in 2 separate plates, both looking like they came out of the Top Chef kitchen. (also, all pasta dishes can be ordered as half portions, which is great, but also keep in mind the regular portions are not huge).Stand outs:- Ahi Tuna Carpaccio- Braised Veal Agnolotti- Branzino-Bucatini-Warm Faro SaladAlso, save room for dessert! One of my best friends will make us journey here just for the Marchesi (a rich chocolate torte covered with pistachios), which he will then refuse to share with anyone. Like seriously if you want a bite he will just buy you your own because he doesn't want to share even a drop of this! its so delicious and decadent. I personally love the panna cotta (served with seasonal fruit topping, the passionfruit is my fav). They also have individually made chocolates, which seems crazy expensive, but they are so delicious, they are really worth it. Fiola Mare is probably the best place to go to celebrate a special occasion or a special someone or just to feel fancy and pamper yourself :)",5,1,0,1
"Henry M.","4/11/2016","Gaithersburg, MD","Crystal and I spent hours celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary at Fiola Mare last night. Yes, it is every bit as expensive as 4 $'s suggest, but if you are comfortable spending that sort of coin on a fine meal, perhaps for a special occasion, then you won't be disappointed. Make your reservation early enough to appreciate the view of the Potomac river when you take advantage of the valet parking, and then get there early enough to have a drink or two at the bar. The drinks are expensive, but they are amazing, and the bartenders are as perfect as the rest of the service that we experienced. Crystal's ""Geisha"" was as beautiful in it's globe with two glass straws and a rubber stopper as it was tasty, and the pansy blossom floated on top was the perfect finishing touch. My smoked (the bartender burnt some sugar and herbs with a cuisine torch) bourbon drink (one of three specials) was a little sweet, but also delicious, balanced, and tasty. The women next to us at the bar changed their orders when they saw how different and interesting our drinks were. I loved that our bartender told us that our table was ready when we were, rather than someone else butting in and dragging us off. The drinks that we had at the bar were so good that we eschewed wine and sought the advice of Douglas, our excellent waiter, for cocktail pairing with our dishes. Crystal's champagne cocktail was the best that we (I had a taste) have had anywhere, and my Foreign Policy, with Beefeater gin, green Chartreuse, limoncello, honey syrup, lemon juice, and a splash of Prosecco sufficent to liven it up, was as herbaceous and balanced as I hoped for. They both went well with our appetizers of Oysters with a zabaglione sauce lightened and frothed further by a little with Prosecco in champagne flutes with a bit of caviar on top, the lightly fried, thick, but not overly large, soft shell crab that tasted more of sweet crab than any other in my experience, and the best sea urchin that I have ever had. Any place. Ever. The sea urchin wasn't on the menu, by the way, but when I mentioned how much I liked the idea of sea urchin in another dish, Douglas suggest the dish of perfectly placed morsels of uni plated in a very shallow pool of flavored oil.Next time we celebrate at Fiola Mare, we may have a fish main and/or the raw-bar seafood platter, but last night we shared pastas. The bucatini was great, but their famous lobster ravioli was truly off the hook. Two half orders of the ravioli was the perfect share for us, since a whole order is 3 of the large ravioli, and each half order (there is an upcharge) has two ravioli in addition to a very nice piece of lobster, all resting in a perfect lobster bisque studded with chive. Even aside from their large size and their unminced filling of perfectly cooked sweet lobster meat, the ravioli themselves are not the typical stamped sort, hand-stamped or machine-stamped (with the pinked edged) or otherwise, or even the small hand-pinched ravioli of some fine Italian restaurants like NYC's Rao, but rather large, extremely supple sachettes/beggar's purses. Wonderful dish!Our not having a main course left room for dessert in spite of our having shared a few drinks apiece, 3 appetizers, and a two and a half rich pasta, and it was our anniversary. We ordered the Chocolate Soufflè Crostata, which was warm and perfect, with Illanka chocolate, cremoso, citrus, a toasted hazelnut crust, and gianduja (saveur.com/article/Trave), and they gave us a slice of a pastry for our anniversary. Crystal's excellent coffee was poured in an exceptionally thin stream from a beautiful pot, and my delicious Blackadder ""raw cask"" Scotch, which is not chill-filtered, and so  cask sediments as well as of natural oilsand fats. Smooth and delicious, with decided butterscotch notes.Did I mention that my favorite drink of the evening featured a strong hint of cucumber? I'd smelled it and asked the bartender about it while we were sitting at the bar, and he said that it is one of his favorites, so I ordered one soon after we were shown to our table, but I don't remember it's name. Guess we'll have to return on another special occasion to find out.",5,5,0,5

The on-the-house tastings as well as the appetizers, wine, main courses and desserts were all amazing. Really great quality and well-prepared food. Great cozy atmosphere and beautiful decor. Only issue was our seating, which is why I am not giving 5 stars. My sister called to request a table with a view or in a quieter section of the restaurant. The staff told her they don't take seating requests, which is fine. However, we were seated right next to the bar, right behind a rather loud and intoxicated group. We had to shout the entire meal to hear each other, which was not pleasant. The group at the bar was 2 or three people deep and also kept bumping into our seats and using our chairs as arm rests. In addition, the waitstaff kept switching out chairs at the table next to ours -- this happened no less than 5 times, with them carrying these chairs back and forth over our heads. Very bizarre.

"Christina G.","4/17/2016","Washington, DC","I was skeptical at first because the Georgetown Waterfront tends to be full of places that are all style and little substance (such as Sequoia) or little style and little substance (such as Tony and Joes and Nicks, both of which can be fun under the right circumstances but not a good bet for dinner). However, Fiola Mare delivered above and beyond expectations. I'm not going to recite a blow-by-blow of our experience because the other reviews cover it well, but here is why I believe they get 5 stars:1. Sea urchin heaven - I'm a sucker for uni and these guys seem to have it in droves. It appears on the raw bar platter, in pasta dishes, antipasti etc. They change the menu all the time and it always seems to be there (not that I check their menu online in order to dream - nope, I'd never do that). 2. Wine list/sommelier service - They have a truly fantastic wine list with a wide range of classic wines and plenty of offbeat options, and the somms seem to really care about helping us find exactly the right bottle for our dinner. We had an orange wine from Paolo Bea, a producer in Umbria whose sagrantino I adore, but had we wanted something more mainstream, I'm sure we would have found an equally delicious option. 3. Raw bar - DC has really upped the ante on the raw bar game in recent years. Used to be that places could have a few types of oysters, maybe some clams and shrimp, and crab claws if you were lucky. Now, all manner of mollusks and crustaceans are de rigeur. I'm a big fan of Fiola Mare's version, which when we were there, included uni, razor clams, king crab and huge head-on prawns in addition to the usual selection of oysters and clams.I would definitely return for a special occasion (or manufacture a special occasion for an excuse to return). These guys are on point in every respect.",5,1,0,1
"Barb B.","4/18/2016","Hermitage, TN","Gorgeous upscale but refreshing and relaxed ambiance with white, maritime, beach theme throughout the restaurant. Reminded me of Charleston, SC in many ways! Food was incredible. We had brunch as a party of 4 on a Saturday with a reservation. Enjoyed a few mimosas at the bar pre-brunch with a witty and friendly bartender. Service was top notch, and the grilled calamari was the most delicious seafood I have ever had in my entire life. An absolute MUST try! The seafood brodetto was also a huge hit with our table. Can't wait to go back! Perfect for special occasions!",5,0,0,1
"Joshua G.","4/18/2016","Manhattan, NY","FOOD- At Fiola Mare, we ate some of the best food we ever had. To start, the pastries and spreads were delicious. A nice blend of sweet and savory (danishes, cinnamon buns + rolls). For appetizers, we each got the buffalo mozzarella. We both agreed it was by far the best mozzarella we've ever eaten. It was so soft and sweet; felt like it was pulled right in the kitchen. Our pasta course(s) were cooked perfectly al dente with just the right amount of sauce and spice for an added kick. Delicious! For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were also cooked to perfection. They were fried but weren't greasy, and sugar coated, yet not too rich. SERVICE-The service at fiola mare is unmatched. To start, the server knew exactly which food to recommend, based on our allergies (which were noted before we even arrived).  When the server's presence was needed, he was always there, yet he wasn't overbearing in the slightest. Every time our drinks neared completion, he came ready to ask if we'd care for another. He was very respectful of our conversations and pleasant when we were conversing with him.  Our server was by far the best we've ever had and should be recognized for his outstanding performance. We were thoroughly pleased and impressed. (This is the first review I've ever written, and am largely writing due to the quality of dining I experienced yesterday at Fiola Mare)AMBIANCE-Picture yourself arriving on the shores of Italy, stepping down from a yacht, and walking up from the sand into nautical yet modern bistro. That is fiola mare.  The ambiance along the Georgetown waterfront makes you feel like you're on vacation, even if you're a local. Would highly recommend to anyone out of town or visiting for the day.WHY 5 STARS?They offered us a complimentary ice cream with dessert and gave us a card for our anniversary. It was a nice gesture and a great added touch! The only time I mentioned our allergies / anniversary was in passing when I made the reservation, and it was obvious they were taking notes. THAT is quality dining. GO TO FIOLA MARE- YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",5,0,0,0

"Jackie N.","4/19/2016","Falls Church, VA","My dad took me here for my birthday a few weeks ago and I could not have been happier.  The restaurant's manager is a close family friend, so we have been dying to try it out.  Fiola Mare made it to the No. 1 spot on the Washingtonian's Top 100 Restaurants for 2016 and I could not agree more.  Besides Rose's Luxury, this is my favorite place I have been to in the DMV.  For starters, we of course got the cold seafood tower. WOWOWOWOWOW - lobster tail, oysters, clams, tuna tartare, prawns, snow crab legs, mussels, sea urchin, etc..  So amazing.  All I wished for my birthday was the seafood tower and my wish was granted.  For entrees, I got the lobster ravioli and the BF got the salmon, so I got to taste his too.  The lobster ravioli knocked my socks off.  It was so good, I can't even begin to describe it!  It came with three pyramids filled with delicious lobster atop a lobster roe broth, which tasted like lobster bisque, and a lobster tail.  Come on.  Granted, the dish is $50, but the best $50 you will ever spend on a pasta dish.  The salmon was also delicious.  It was a great cut of fish, but compared to the lobster ravioli, it lacked a teeny bit of flavor.  Food gods forgive me - I am only saying that because the lobster ravioli is just sooooo knock you in the face flavorful and tasty, that most things do not compare.  Sigh.  Now I'm hungry.  As for sides, we had the wilted spinach with garlic and warm faro salad.  Both were great.  We were also given a veal pasta dish which was good, but I do not see it on their website's menu.  For dessert, we were spoiled.  We got their special cherry blossom dessert, which was a cherry cheesecake with matcha....erhmagawd...the best thing EVER.  We also go to try their famous bomboloni [ricotta doughnuts with gelato and salted caramel sauce], piemontese warm chocolate cake, and the marchesi, which if my memory serves me right, was a chocolate fudgey dessert. All in all, Fiola Mare is truly an experience for a special occasion or for when you just want to splurge a little with your bae.  The brunch is also great.  They do a la carte, or you can go fancy and do the $48 signature brunch, which lasts from 11:30 to 2pm.  You get a choice of bottomless brunch cocktails, a warm basket of pastries and breads to share including croissant, pain au chocolate, and a cinnamon roll.  Then, you choose an antipasti from list of salads and soups, and a main course, which has choices including lemon ricotta pancakes (delicious), pastas, and their version of an eggs benedict.  THEN you get to choose a dessert.  This brunch is not for the faint of heart.",5,7,5,5

"Kate K.","5/1/2016","Arlington, VA","I enjoyed an anniversary dinner at FM where we started at the very light-filled front bar before dinner (under heaters on a clear but chilly April evening) on the waterfront terrace. It's certainly a special-occasion or business expense place, but lives up to the prices with spectacular food, attentive and intelligent service and a setting that you'd pay for on its own. I didn't realize until after we left that there was another bar in the back of the restaurant - though the front bar was lovely, it was a little cramped and this other one felt more appealing and comfortable.",4,0,0,0

"Asha M.","5/3/2016","New York, NY","My roommate and I went to fiola mare as our last brunch before we both leave dc. We were very happy with it and definitely thought it was worth it.Out of all the drinks the sangria was definitely the best. It was pretty sweet and reminded me of the jazz in the gardens sangria. The bellini and mimosa mostly tasted like champagne and didnt have much either taste. But the sangria was amazing so we were pleased with sticking to that.The bread basket is absolutely amazing. All the breads are delicious and they give you enough pieces for everyone. My favorite was the bread filled with chocolate because it was just big enough and had the right amount of sweetness.For appetizers i got the sea scallop carpacchio which i was pleased with because it was very light and tasty. My roommate got the buffalo mozzarella but there was a bit too much cheese for her to finish it.For entrees i got the mussel bucatini and this was definitely the most disappointing of the meal. It was waaaay too salty and pretty impossible to finish without gulping down water. My roommate got the rigatoni carbonara and it was pretty good.The dessert for me is what made this one of the best brunches we've had. My roommate got the bomboloni and the caramel sauce was delicious. It tasted like melted werthers candies. I got the marchesi and this dessert combined three of my favoritr things. Dark chocolate. Pistachio cream. And fresh mint. It was honestly the best dessert i have ever had.Overall we were very happy with the brunch and the price point was excellent for what we got.",4,0,0,0

"S. N.","5/8/2016","West Palm Beach, FL","I'll start with the positive. The food was amazing and lived up to all the hype from what all of our friends had told us and the reviews had said about this place. The lobster ravioli and olive oil halibut are the must haves if you go here! The pace of service was perfect. The spacing in between courses was perfect. They gave us just enough time to relax and chit chat in between courses. They didn't have the dessert wine that we ordered but they brought one that was still very good and it was on the house which we greatly appreciated.The negative was the service. Our waiter was difficult to get a hold of. He would come to our table to take our order but he would leave in a blink of an eye that we wouldn't have a chance to order one more cup of coffee for one of us at the table. We would try to wave him down but he would never look in our direction. We would try to joke a little with him to warm him up because his demeanor was a bit cold but it didn't work. We moved here from NYC a little over 2 years ago and have found that in quite a few restaurants that more often than not the food is great but the service is not. This one was particularly frustrating. We were celebrating an MBA graduation and it would have been nice to end the day on a high note.",4,2,0,1
"Thomas W.","5/12/2016","New York, NY","There is something about a brunch in Georgetown that defies any description.  Brunch after all is something truly not well defined.  Fiola Mare, while one of the better restaurants in the DC area, is not quite ready for elevation to legendary status on the banks of the Potomac.  Still, I love the scallops, the lobster ravioli, and the tagliatelle with langoustine at this up and coming Georgetown neighborhood gem.  Fiola Mare only needs to pass the test of time to become the new in spot for the Washington elite.  Power lunches certainly set the DC area apart from all other great restaurant cities in North America like New York, LA, and San Francisco.  Great seafood, and a romantic atmosphere in Georgetown--What more could a person ask for!",5,1,1,1

I was immediate impressed with the waterfront view and the beautiful setting of the restaurant.Along with the 3-course brunch, we also ordered the oysters. I always though I knew good oysters, but these topped them all. Also, unlike most places that give horseradish, lemon, and hot sauce, this place did not. They give 2 house sauces that are the best I have ever had, and complemented then oysters very well. If they would have sold these sauces to take home, I would have wiped them out. They also offered a basket of pastries and bread which was so delicious!I do not usually eat pasta, however as it is an italian place, I decided to give it a try... I am happy I did! It was so good and it tasted so fresh and homemade. The breakfast cocktails we had were amazing as well. Last but not least, the service was perfect. The only reason that I am happy I cannot patronize here all the time (it is a bit pricey) is that the amazing food and impeccable service would ruin every other place for me.

"Jane R.","5/22/2016","Raleigh, NC","When a restaurant is ranked as the top one in a major city, there are certain expectations for a near-perfect experience. And that may be difficult for a restaurant as large as Fiola Mare to deliver. We went there for lunch/brunch on a rainy Saturday and with graduations underway, it was very busy. I had the Colors of the Garden salad, which was fine (and fortunately wasn't overdressed), the Lemon Pancakes (good, but the fruit on top and mascarpone were the best parts of it), and the Bomboloni for dessert (it was special to get donut holes just out of the oven). My guest had the Spaghetti with King Crab, which he finished completely, noting that he normally doesn't finish all of an entrée, and had lived in Alaska and had consumed a lot of King Crab while there. The food was very good, but it was quite noisy - we were seated on the covered patio area inside, which might have had less soundproofing that the regular interior rooms. Fiola Mare had the largest number of staff I've ever seen at a restaurant, but they probably could have checked in more often. One unique aspect of the service was that it seemed like each dish was presented by a different person; I'm not sure if they were the one who had prepared the item, but each showed pride in presenting the dish. I thought our server said that there were unlimited Bellinis with the brunch, but no one ever offered another after I finished the first (which was virgin). I'm wondering how different the experience would have been at dinner than at lunch, but we were overall pleased with this restaurant selection.",4,1,0,0

"Rebecca D.","6/3/2016","Boston, MA","Last night I had the pleasure of dining at Fiola Mare. Everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was incredibly well executed. To start we ordered the Colors of the Garden Salad. What I loved about this salad was the variety of ingredients such as golden beets, fava beans, radishes, marcona almonds, strawberries and pickled rhubarb. Unlike most restaurants, this salad was delicately dressed which allowed all of the flavors to stand out. For entrees we each ordered something different. I enjoyed the Pan-Roasted Wild Halibut and thought it was one of the best entrees that I have ever had. And to be honest, for $44 it should be! My boyfriend ordered the Adriatic Seafood Brodetto which is made up of a ton of fresh seafood in a saffron broth. His meal was so delicious that we ended up asking for bread to soak up the broth with! My father ordered the Simply Grilled Wild Calamari. Fiola Mare has a section on their menu called ""Simply Grilled"" where you can order just the seafood on it's own. My father's calamari was absolutely delicious and a HUGE portion for $24! Since we were celebrating our reunion we decided that dessert was necessary. We ordered the Warm Strawberry Crostata which served four people for $28. The portion was just the right size and was presented adorably. Overall, Fiola Mare was a 10 out of 10 for all of us.

When I learned that they offer one of the best brunch prefixes in the city, I knew exactly where I wanted my first birthday meal to be. Fiola sure knows how to make a birthday girl feel special. Our server welcomed us with bubbles on the house and seated us at the best table in the restaurant! I was constantly greeted with ""happy birthday"" and checked on by passing servers. The most beautiful bread basket was delivered almost instantly. And this was all just the first impression. Brunch prefix consisted of three courses plus a classic cocktail or mocktail. Honestly one of the best deals of DC! My husband and I shared the chopped Angus beef and Burrata to start. Each appetizer could had been an entree alone. The portions were beyond generous. The chopped Angus beef was beautifully seasoned. The burrata was out of the world creamy. Although we were initially given a bread basket (which consisted of mostly sweet pastries), I wished they had served savory breads or crackers with the two appetizers. Unless they expect me to eat the burrata just as a giant ball of gooey cheese... For entrees, I opted for the shrimp and polenta while my husband went with the king crab spaghetti. The shrimp and polenta was similar to shrimp and grits I've had in other restaurants. The tiger shrimp were perfectly cooked. The sauce was delectable! The polenta was creamy and cheesy. For once, I wished there were actually more polenta (grits) to go with my shrimp! My husband thoroughly enjoyed his dish - juicy crab meat, creamy tomato sauce folded in perfectly made spaghetti. The bowl was cleaned. Before we could finish ordering our desserts, our server ensured us that they were being taken care of. I wasn't sure what he meant until I saw that he brought out all 3 options plus a mini cake and customized card. What a nice touch! I'm glad we were able to sample all 3 choices - The chocolate terrain was rich and decadent. The panna cotta was velvety and creamy. The ricotta donuts with caramel sauce single handedly won my husband to come back. Too good. $48 - 5 stars quality and service with the most beautiful, scenic view of Georgetown waterfronts.

We walked up to the host guarding the outside area and asked to be seated. He made a big deal about us not having a reservation, but the place was empty! After struggling to communicate for two minutes, he told us to walk down the block and go up to the terrace. We proceeded to the terrace and sat ourselves (no host). Then, after about five minutes, Joel approached to take our drink order. I (half) jokingly asked him what was up with the rude host and the reservation situation. He responded saying he was not ""comfortable"" serving me alcohol. Mind you, although I was admittedly giddy and gregarious (hello weekend-Missy J!), I was also 110% sober. I sat there for a moment, completely dumbfounded, before saying, ""you're joking, right?"" He stared at me blankly and replied, ""I think you should leave."" I then asked to speak to the manager, who was equally as rude and apathetic. As we were speaking to him, Joel stood at his side, smirking at us. I've never been so disrespected in a restaurant in my entire life. I still don't understand what happened. It's as if they wanted us to work for the privilege of dining with them. We were both wearing jeans, but we were well-dressed with nice shoes. The outdoor area certainly didn't exude an upscale-attire ambiance. It was truly a real-life Pretty Woman moment. I've never experienced anything like it.  Unlike Julia Roberts, however, I don't plan on returning to buy out the restaurant to prove a point. It's disgusting that they treat other human beings in that manner. If you look at all the other one-star reviews, you'll see I'm not the only one who experienced this kind of degradation. Take heed. There are plenty of other high-end restaurants in DC that understand that service is a critical part of dining.",1,8,3,1
"Jess L.","6/15/2016","Westchester County, NY","*** 3,500th review ***A truly delectable dining experience. This is the place to go if you're looking for seafood. First-class service! Our waitress was great at suggestions as well as explaining the dishes. She really couldn't have been better. Drinks: There's a really tight cocktail menu. I loved my Spring Garden ($16), with vodka, ginger, and lime juice; and my husband's Sapore Vero was a very well-crafted rye cocktail with a bit of sweetness. When it came to wine during the meal, the Francois Crochet, Les Perrois, Sauvignon Blanc, Sancerre 2015 ($68) was great for all the different seafood dishes on the table. The somm gave us a great description of a few options. Highlights for the starters: My dad's Under the Sea was decadent and unique. Definitely for those who are daring! The Colors of the Garden was unlike any salad I've ever had before, which amazing textures, colors, and a bit of acidity. Also, we got a half-portion of the braised veal tortellini, which I definitely would have been eating a full portion of. Delicious and well balanced.Main: For two, the Grand Adriatic Grilled Seafood ($95) is definitely a great strategy for a bunch of pure, delicious seafood. They certainly do not skimp on portions or quality of seafood in this dish. The grilled fishes, too, are very true to the ingredients and very satisfying. Dessert: The donuts are a great way to end the meal if you're looking for something to share. A very high recommendation, especially for a special occasion and those who are a bit adventurous with food.",5,10,1,9

"James K.","6/20/2016","Fairfax, VA","One of those special dining experiences that deserves every accolade it's gotten. From the food to the service to the location this place is first-class all the way. Then again, given the expense, it certainly should be!We started with the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio, which if offered in an entree portion I could eat every single day of my life. It is just that good. I hope this is a mainstay on the menu because for me it's worth going back for. For entrees we got the Lobster ravioli served alongside chunks of lobster meat in a sauce that I think is made from the happy tears of unicorns. We also ordered the halibut filet which was incredibly good but surprisingly what I remember most was that the accoutrements served with it was equal to the fish in every way. We finished up with coffee and chocolate cake to end what was an altogether unforgettable dining experience.It's been mentioned already in other reviews but it's clear that part of the expense of dining here goes into the service. The server to table ratio is particularly high with each one ready for whatever it was that you needed. Coming here you get to experience why it is that people pay top-dollar to eat out. It's not just for the food but the whole experience. Add in the Georgetown waterfront location and you've got the perfect recipe for a singular dining experience.",5,1,0,0

I didn't like the colors of the garden salad but that's just me. Ask the waiter or waitress a lot of questions on what your ordering, that way you know what you're getting into.

"Jacqueline H.","6/25/2016","Oakland, CA","Exceptional. One of the best meal experiences I have had in a long time. Came here with a few girlfriends for Sunday brunch and were highly impressed. The manager as well as kitchen manager came out to check on us in person, the server was happy to make suggestions and immediately knew when you needed something without us having to ask. We did the unlimited drink brunch option and it was certainly a lot of food! We were sad to not be able to finish all of it. The salads were by far the stars of lunch with fresh burrata that tasted as if they just made it! The pasta and eggs Benedict were also to die for. We were starving when we first sat down and made the mistake of eating way to much of the warm pastry basket. Whilst it was delicious, the lemon ricotta pancakes we couldn't finish at the end definitely would have been worth more tummy space! Gorgeous views, delicious food and exceptional staff.

We started with cocktails - delicious and a very pretty presentation, although I would say a couple dollars overpriced. Standard I suppose for a waterfront restaurant. I had the Spring Garden and The Mayflower and would recommend both. Next, we ordered the Simply Grilled Wild Calamari as an appetizer - BEST THING I'VE EVER TASTED. The calamari was mostly bodies (as opposed to tentacles) and was so tender and flavorful. We asked for more bread to dip in the juices. It was divine. Next we shared two half portions - the Lobster Ravioli and the Bucatini. Both delicious. I thought the prawn in the Bucatini and the piece of lobster in the Ravioli were both slightly overcooked but not enough to change how much we enjoyed the meal. The three dishes and the bread left us full but not uncomformably stuffed. Wonderful dinner overall!",5,0,0,0

"Marines M.","7/4/2016","Manhattan, NY","If you want an amazing DC experience this can absolutely be it.  After a walk through Georgetown you can head down to the river for a beautiful stroll by the water and end at this restaurant for a wonderful meal by the water.Everything I had was superb!  Make sure you share so you can try more as potions are a good size for sharing and not be full after only a few dishes.Starting with the Colors of a Garden salad which had a wide variety of vegetables lightly covered with a very light, summery dressing.  Followed the salad with perfectly grilled calamari.  Menu calls a portion a pound of calamari, but the waitress was very accommodating to bring half pound of the very tender, perfectly grilled mollusk covered with olive oil and accompanied with an aioli dipping sauce.  Had I not already ordered the much praised Lobster Ravioli I would have ordered that 2nd half pound of calamari.  Now before I went on to try the ravioli I also shared the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio which was incredibly fresh and had amazing flavor.  It was also covered with a few slightly salted capers that made it a perfect fresh dish.Glad I didn't skip the ravioli ... it was absolutely delicious!  The sauce is creamy, but not heavy nor overpowering.  It perfectly complements and brings out the subtle flavor of the lobster.  Don't be shy ... feel free to clean out the plate with the scrumptious  French bread ... I did!  Couldn't finish this meal without ordering dessert.  I did have to say, of all the dishes it's the one I didn't like quite as much, but it was still pretty good.  I had the Marchesi and I don't qualify it as a favorite only because I prefer milk to dark chocolate and the waitress warned me that because it's Italian strong milk chocolate it would still be fairly strong (bitter) which is not my favorite.The food can only be compared to the great service and the great, welcoming decor of the locale.  This is now one of my favorite DC spots!",5,0,0,0

The seafood grill is delicious, as is the lobster ravioli. Don't be afraid to try a pasta you don't recognize ... the unique and complex flavors are well worth it! Highly recommended!",5,0,0,0
"Robin V.","7/5/2016","Los Angeles, CA","What an enjoyable meal! From start to finish, every bite was so delicious. A lot of the flavors were influenced by Japanese cuisine (dashi in particular) and found that interesting and especially cool. We had the Under the Sea as a stater as well as the mozarella, which I was particular impressed with. The chef included a complimentary dish after the server had asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and I had replied Fathers Day (yes I know - very belated!). My pasta sauce reminded me so much of the pasta sauce in Japanese pasta. Yum! There was a bit of spicyness to it to that I enjoyed. The wine was fab as well. I would certainly recommend this to someone, especially if the weather cooperates so you can sit outside on the waterfront. As for parking, they validate and it costs $16; without it is $20. I was lucky enough to find street parking so I only had to pay $5.",4,0,0,0

"Sarah W.","7/11/2016","Sacramento, CA","Came out to Fiola Mare for my first time after a boat trip on the Potomac River. It wasn't overly crowded, and so we did not need a reservation to sit outside. It was probably around 6:30 pm on Sunday. We ordered a few drinks and the Halibut dinner entree. It took awhile to get our food and the waiver did notice. He offered us a complimentary glass of wine for the slow service, but we declined since I was interested in having a Manhattan. Not sure if we were charged or not for that drink, but they did offer us a small dessert after dinner. I have to say the food is awesome. The wait staff is top notch. The only problem I could see with this place is that the people sitting along the fence outside the restaurant can be disturbed by passerby's. My boyfriend and I were sitting next to a couple when a man came up and started singing to us. He wasn't even good. The couple closer to the fence had to pay the man to go away and leave them alone. The wait staff saw the man disturbing the table and did nothing about it. Overall the experience was nice and the food delicious!",4,0,0,0

"Sonia N.","7/12/2016","Boston, MA","Awesome experience at FM.  This is a beautiful upscale seafood restaurant located on the water with gorgeous panoramic views of the Potomac River.  Perfect setting as we came on a weekend night right before sunset.   As we were whisked away to our corner table, the ambiance only got better with the lovely candlelit tables, open faced kitchen and water views.  Service was spectacular.  Our service team of 3 definitely made sure that we were taken care of.  They went over the entire menu and offered suggestions when we were undecided.  Our waters were routinely filled, silverware changed and our wine always topped off.  5/5For starters, we shared a half dozen oysters but split it evenly between their 3 choices (Kumamoto, Pink Moon and Chunu).  All were exquisite.   Highly recommend ordering it just the same way.  It was a great way to taste all the different finishes. 5/5We also had the house specialty Under the Sea crudo.  LOVED this and it was one of the best appetizers I tried during my entire stay and we had many great contenders.  Excellent presentation, very fresh and the combo of seafood was very unique.  5/5For dinner, we tried the Squid Ink Campanelle and the Simply Grilled Snapper.   The pasta was very well prepared and delicious (4/5) but the grilled snapper, while fresh and high quality, didn't have much to it (3/5).  We realize that it is ""simply grilled"" but I also thought that the portion could've been slightly larger (see pic).   Perhaps we are pretty tough graders on seafood being from New England but I also wasn't too crazy about the potato side we tried either.  Overall, this is really a 4.5 but rounded down only because of the extra $ this is in relation to the value we received but for a special occasion, it is definitely worth the splurge :D",4,2,0,0

"Nick S.","7/22/2016","Vienna, VA","We finally tried Fiola Mare after being off and on about going somewhere that you had to reserve so far in advance (well, if you don't want to eat at 5pm or 9:30pm). It basically met expectations of what I assumed it would be. We tried oysters, tiger prawn bucatini, and pan-roasted halibut. The oysters were awesome, very fresh, and the sauces they provided were nice with one having a great vinegar flavor. My halibut was cooked perfectly and had nice earthy flavors, although I generally like spicy in-your-face flavors. The tiger prawn were large and well cooked, the bucatini was super garlicky (that's a positive), and the cocktails were also very nice. I tried something called a Smoked where they set wood chips on fire and smoke your glass. That's a man's drink, for sure. They also made a nice manhattan and a fairly good margarita (we asked for patron and cointreau and the bartender said all their margaritas have cointreau - good answer). If I had any complaint about the menu, it would be the selection. I was looking for great raw tuna dishes but they weren't there. I don't like pasta (the bucatini was ordered by my fiance) or tons of carbs in general, which left me with only three dishes on the menu to choose from. But what was there was good.Concerning the atmosphere, I'm a casual kind of person. It's very normal for me to show up to a place like this in shorts and a t-shirt (which I did). I'm in my 30s and I'd say the average age of the customers was probably more like 55 with a range of 30-80. Most of the people were wearing things like khakis and a blue sport coat, which made me feel like I was back in private school in Kentucky in the 1990s. The upside of this demographic is that it's not super loud like many of the ""hip"" DC restaurants full of 20-40 year olds. At the end of the day the food was great, as was the service, but the environment is a little too traditional and straight-laced for me.",4,0,0,0

"Alice W.","7/23/2016","Falls Church, VA","Birthday celebrations continue! Last night, I came here with a few friends to continue my birthday shenanigans. Although both the indoor bars were full, we were able to snag a table on the boardwalk with a great view of the Potomac River, Teddy Roosevelt Island, and JFK Center. I opted for one of their featured cocktails, the Mayflower ($16). It's rose infused gin with peach puree, Cointreau, lemon juice, lavender syrup, and peach bitters. A very nice, slightly sweet cocktail. Perfect for the summer. We shared a dozen Chunu (Smith Island, VA) and Kusshi oysters (Vancouver Island, Canada). Half dozen oysters are $18 and a full dozen is $36. I preferred the Kusshi oysters because they have a cleaner and mildly sweet taste. The BF and I shared the squid ink campanelle ($32) and a side of wilted spinach ($10). The squid ink campanelle has octopus ragu, Manila clams, red onion wild oregano, pickled fresno chiles, and grated bottarga. The staff thoughtfully split our dish for us before bringing it to the table. It's a delicious pasta dish. The chiles bring out a hint of spiciness. I highly recommend to order any of their pasta dishes, as that is what the Fiola team excels at. They have half portion and gluten-free pasta available too.

The best part was the pureed green chili salsa that came as a dipping sauce. The scallops were just delicious. Definitely tasted like the sea as soon as you bite into it. Spritz some lemon and dip it in the sauce...golden! For entrees, we went ham on everything. We tried almost all the pasta dishes in half sizes. Here's how i ranked them - 1. Mafalde, which was a veal ragu with black truffles and mushrooms 2. Squid ink campanelle 3. Lobster rav 4. Bucatini with fresh prawns. Everything was really really really good!

"B S.","8/11/2016","Washington, DC","This hurts me more than your know because FM is one of my favorites and I love love everything ...until today.  My past visits, I've had impeccable service and food.  Generally you expect that both factors (service and food) are at the top of their  game for a restaurant of this caliber, but given that we are in DC I am pleased if one factor is super strong. Service today was basically if I was at Clyde's...and that's being generous.  I couldn't get a wine refill to save my life ($30 a glass) ...I asked to confirm if the lobster ravioli could still be done gluten free, instead of telling me yes they just brought it to me but my dining companion didn't even order his dinner!  When we finally order, I feel like they brought be the same lobster penne dish from 30 minutes earlier because it was cold and rock hard (as GL pasta gets). There was a piece of lobster and very runny sauce - I mean I have this all the time and it is what I come back for and what I was craving for days.  My dining companion is a vegetarian and the waiter was so passive about offering him a vegetarian pasta option --- as if it would take sooooooooooo much work to accommodate.  It's pasta, which is what you are GOOD at.  He didn't even eat his dinner, it was just tasteless.  To go back to service, we rarely saw our server, we waited a while for cocktail/wine refills and finally to actually order dinner together!  I just don't know....given what we spent we could have eaten at Clyde's with a party of 10.",1,1,0,0

BOMB!  Mafalde? Super BOMB!  Dover Sole? Amazingly BOMB!!  Caviar? Uhhhhh do I even have to say it?The whole experience was beyond expectation and the service was some of the best that I have ever had.  As I had mentioned earlier, I had casually noted that we were celebrating our Anniversary during the reservation process.  As it turns out, they took note of that and throughout our meal, various members of the staff continually came by to wish us a Happy Anniversary.  Not only was this thoughtful, it was that attention to detail that made it feel like a one of a kind experience.  Even our dessert came with extra goodies and a card from the staff wishing us a Happy Anniversary.All in all, we had an amazing night with the amazing staff here and will definitely be back for more.",5,2,2,2
"Elisa P.","8/15/2016","Springfield, VA","The sweetie took me here for my birthday dinner. Premise: I'm Italian from Italy. Cocktail: I had the spring garden cocktail. It was light and fresh. A nice balance between citrus and sweet. The cucumber granita was a nice touch texture wise. Appetizer: we split the burrata. The quality of the raw ingredient was very high. The mozzarella was creamy and milky. I'm glad we split the appetizer because it was a generous portion. Main course: - Bigoli: the pairing of the mushrooms and truffle is very typical of central Italy. They light sauce nicely brought all of the ingredients together without masking the flavors of the various components of the dish. I appreciated the use of the veal ragu instead of heavier meats or sausages. It gave an extra layer of texture to the dish without being overpowering or too heavy. - Adriatic seafood brodetto: all the fish was super fresh, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection even if several of the ingredients have different cooking times. Dessert: marchesi. I appreciated the presentation and different textures. To be honest, I was a little stuffed by then and the chocolate was a little rich. The pistachio ice cream tastes like heaven though. Perfect end to an amazing night. Service was impeccable. It was the perfect venue to celebrate my birthday!",5,1,0,0

When using caviar and black truffle to accentuate it is easy to allow a single ingredient to overpower the others. The chef found the perfect harmony of the each dish. The execution echoes the simplicity of traditional Italian cuisine, like a chorus allowing each component of the dish to sing on its own.",5,2,0,0

Truffle oil came to me by surprise and it was very pleasing to the palate. The 1 lb calamari was perfectly juicy with just the right hint of chili. Mmmm!

She took the time to go through the menu dishes and explained the flavors and textures of each. I ordered a mocktail, Peach Blossom, which was sweet and refreshing. For appetizers, I shared an oyster dish with my co-worker. We ordered three types of oysters: cunchi, pink moon, well fleet. The cunchi was the smallest and had a sweet flavor, while the pink moon was salty to the taste. The well fleet was the largest and had a briny taste. My entree order was the Strozzapreti pasta which was a cream-based hollow noodle with shrimp and mussels. It was good, but a bit too salty for my taste. Overall the food was good and I would definitely recommend this place for someone looking to host a special occasion.",4,1,0,2

The food was *almost* amazing, but my lobster ravioli could have used salt in both the pasta and the sauce. There was also a bit of acidity missing that could have made the dish that much more flavorful, especially for being a $50 entree, but that's probably due to the sizable portion of lobster meat you get rather than the dish itself.

"Briana Y.","8/30/2016","Los Angeles, CA","Horrible service. We had a reservation, and when we first arrived they were late in seating us. There were plenty of empty tables available, so there was almost no point in making a reservation. After that, our waiter took an extremely long time to finally come to our table to take our order. Once we ordered, our waiter never once came to ask how the food was. When we needed our waiter and had to leave at the end of the meal, he was no where to be seen and I kept looking around the room for him. We sat there for awhile and finally I flagged down another waitress to help us. When they packed our food away that we couldn't finish in a box, I asked them to pack a sauce in a separate container so that it wouldn't get all over the food. The other waiter said he couldn't do that and didn't even try to make an effort to see if he could accommodate such a simple task. I've eaten at hundreds of restaurants and have never been to one that couldn't do this. He didn't even go out of his way to try to see if there was anything he could do. I've had better service at a chain restaurant. For the high prices you pay at a restaurant of this caliber, they should have much better service. We were brushed aside by those two waiters, and I would never expect that kind of service at this type of restaurant. As a whole, I was thoroughly disappointed and will not be coming back.",1,1,0,0
"Kyle C.","8/31/2016","Oakton, VA","This five-star review honestly feels like a freebie.  This seafood place right on the river has a rep and it did not disappoint.  My experience demonstrated to me that this restaurant is a flawless execution of an approachable and unintimidating fine dining seafood experience.  It never felt pretentious or self-important, but the presentation of the dishes was absolutely incredible and the food was fresh, delicate, and most importantly: tasty.  It didn't hurt that our waitress was professional, friendly, and always made herself available to help.Presentation-wise, the most impressive dish was definitely the lobster appetizer, which is served almost raw and is incredibly tasty and delicate.  The tuna appetizer was also delicious and probably my personal favorite.  I ordered the gazpacho as my starter, which was tasty and impressive looking, but slightly strange, as the crab meat was jellied, but it was something different and I appreciated that.  My entree was absolutely incredible.  I can't recommend the lobster ravioli enough.  Almost an entire lobster is used and no other filler.  The lobster is placed into delicate, hand-made raviolis and served with a full lobster claw and half the tail and it is all covered in one of the tastiest sauces I've ever had the privilege of enjoying.  It didn't seem like a lot of food when it first arrived, but I was totally satisfied at the end and even had room for all the desserts that came afterwards.We opted for the warm cinnamon donuts with salted caramel sauce and everyone described them as ""life-changing,"" and I couldn't agree more.  They are everything you'd look for in a donut and sauce, and it even came with a delicious ice cream to compliment the warmth of the fresh-fried donuts. To top off what had been an incredible meal, the waitress had talked to us for a bit and learned about some exciting events in our lives and brought us multiple free desserts in addition to the incredible, aforementioned donuts.  Next time I'm wondering where to go for a special occasion or just feel like eating incredible food, I know where I'll be going.",5,2,0,0
"Courtney M.","9/1/2016","Arlington, VA","My husband and I came here for his birthday. They sat in a corner seat and it was perfect! They gave us complimentary champagne, too! For dessert we received a berry/ cheesecake type dessert, it was delicious! The service was awesome and we loved our waiter.Here is a list of what we ordered:Wine - a Chianti, name: Isole e Olena 2013. Very good! We loved it. It retails in store for $23-25 and they sell it for $66. Oh the restaurant mark ups. Under the sea - various raw seafoods and a cold sauce poured over it. Amazing!! My husband is a huge sushi lover and loved this!Pastas - all half portions and great sizes for two. We had leftovers. Defiantly order more than one! Gragnano Spaghetti Chitarra - Littleneck clams, tomatoes, parsley, and chilies. Very good! Reminded me of a pomodoro sauce. I didn't taste any chilies though. Loved it though, the clams were good and plenty of them. Rigatoni - white shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, tomatoes, basil and some spice to it. We actually received this one on accident and I'm SO glad we did. It ended up being one of my favorites. With all the seafood, tomato sauce and spice is was SO good! Fiola Mare Lobster Ravioli - sauce was creamy and made of butter and chives. Holy moley... No words for this. Absolutely delicious. Must try! Bucatini all'Amatriciana - onions, wild mushrooms, chile, pecorino Romano, and guanciale (meat - pork). Also very good! The bucatini (pasta) is homemade and fresh. Great flavors. I do wish there was more sauce and less vegetables, it was a bit chunky. Spanish Branzino - white fish - we ordered the whole serving. For two people it was a lot. It could easily feed four. It was cooked very well. I wasn't blown away though. I love Branzino, it's my favorite fish. The fish was a bit dry without a sauce on top of it. It should be accompanied by some sort of sauce or drizzle. They use lemon and oil but that doesn't add that much.Sides - crushed smoked potatoes, they were good. A tad dry. Also the wilted spinach, we didn't even eat it. We were so full but his point haha Dessert - birthday dessert I mentioned above and then we got Coppetta (3 scoops of homemade Gelato). We got chocolate, vanilla and pistachio. All very tasty. I've had gelato in Italy so nothing can really top that haha. My husband loved it though. One side note though, it is summer and it was really really hot in the restaurant. Not sure why, but be mindful haha. My husband was sweating.",5,4,3,4

We ordered the portion that serves 1-3 but I'd say it's enough 6 people. 2 of indulged in the lobster ravioli, tile fish, gnocchi. All were fantastic except for mine- which was quickly remade. We finished our meals with the chocolate lava cake, the bombilinas, and the lemon gelato dessert. All were fantastic but if I had to choose my favorite it would be the lava cake- best I've ever had.

I requested seating overlooking the water to experience the whole effect.  Upon arrival we were told told our table wasn't ready and we're instructed to go in the bar for a drink.  Well the bar was packed and no seating available. We waited 30+ minutes after our reservation time before we were ushered to a back room to our table. Not the table I requested, but as I was told there are no guarantees,  I asked if we could be reseated at another table and was told yes but it would be a bit.  After another 20 or so minutes we were seared on the outside (enclosed ) area with little air conditioning.  July in DC is not somewhere you want to sit in an enclosed non air conditioned area and try to enjoy a high end meal.

The sommerlier was helpful and the lobster ravioli was delicious, but everything beyond this was lacking. We had a large delay between our entrees and appetizers.  We were told the kitchen was slow and were asked if we'd like more bread but that bread never came despite our requests for more. We had to ask for quite a few items multiple times (bread, water, etc.) throughout the meal. The supporting servers did a good job with keeping the table clean, but we repeatedly had to search for our main server.  When the entrees finally came out, the food was completely cold.  All of the entrees we had ordered should have been hot dishes.  The grilled seafood we had ordered seems to have sat out for a while and some of the seafood was a bit rubbery.I know we weren't the only ones who had a disappointing dining experience.  Another table near us was so upset with the service that they cancelled their meal and asked to pay for their cocktails and leave.  I can't blame them - we had the same server and he was really bad.Really disappointed given all the great reviews we've seen for this place and because we've had great meals at Fiola in the past.  Next time we have out of town guests, we'll have to take them elsewhere.",2,0,0,0

Although I'd take out the prawns 1-2 min sooner and pasta even more aldente --would've been Italian-perfect.. But I totally understand pasta has to be cooked the way it appeals to the majority of diners.  Hawaiian marlin (ceviche style) w/ mint leaves was amazing.  Burrata was great enough and not lopsided-creamy or runny like some other so-called fine dining places.

When I bit down on my sword fish pasta, I couldn't help seeing the white uncooked parts that was tough to chew.Service was overall fine, and the three course brunch special at $45 per person was a good deal that let you try several dishes.

"Lien L.","9/25/2016","Falls Church, VA","Please be careful, I want to let everyone know about Fiola Mare restaurant. On Wednesday night 9/21/2016, 3 friends from San Antonio,1 from Utah and I had dinner at Fiola Mare restaurant. I used the restaurant valet parking and unfortunately did not think to take in a leather pouch with a significant amount of cash my friends and I had struggled to pool together for a special reunion, plus a small gold bar that I inherited from my family. The pouch was hidden inside my console and under a number of other things. When we came out I thankfully thought to check for the pouch and it was missing! We filed a police report, but no one was arrested. My car had not been broken into so it had to be one of the valets. The restaurant was not helpful and I would think they would want to know that the valets they employ are stealing from their patrons. I am telling this story in social media and will contact nbc4 news and other journalists to help spread the word.  Protect your personal belongings if you go to Fiola Mare  restaurant and know the management won't help if the valets steal from you.

They really will give your table away if you are exactly 15 minutes late.

"Jeanne K.","10/6/2016","Potomac, MD","I have mixed feelings about this place. The food was great but my overall experience was uncomfortable, specifically with the temperature of the restaurant, so when I remember my visit, I always think of that over the food. I've never had this experience before at a nice restaurant, so I left confused.Thoughts:I find it strange for temperature maintenance to be an issue at a nice restaurant such as Fiola Mare. Yes it was July in DC, however, the restaurant is no longer that new to the area, and for the price we're paying for the food, the last thing I want to worry about is the temperature of the restaurant. Management should figure out how to maintain the temperature throughout the restaurant. The waitstaff was very friendly and professional, which I appreciated, and the food was excellent. But I was so uncomfortable the whole time that I couldn't fully appreciate the service or food.Full story: I came for my birthday dinner near the end of July, so it a pretty hot and humid day. We got to the restaurant and were seated near the bar. We didn't like the location and thought the atmosphere of the main room was better, and so our waitress moved us right away. A few minutes after we sat down, we noticed that it was pretty warm in the main room, but we thought we'd cool down after sitting out and adjusting. However it only felt as if it were getting warmer. As the appetizers came out, because of the food, it got even hotter. We addressed this with the staff, and they said the ac was all the way up and that we were close to the doors, which made the main room warmer than usual. (however, we were not that close to the doors) They offered to move us to another room, which was more removed and much cooler, however, we really wanted to stay in the main room with the nice atmosphere. When the mains came, it was just so hot that I was uncomfortable. After the mains, we requested to move to the other room, and we were moved promptly. HOWEVER, the other room was SO cold. For the first few minutes, it was a nice relief and we were happy, but after 10 minutes, we were so cold. This other room was closer to the doors in my opinion, but it was drastically colder than the main room. By the time we were done with dessert and paying the check, we booked it out to escape the coldness. I find whole experience this so bizarre at such a nice restaurant.Food review: But okay, the food. If the rating were just on the food, I'd give it 4.5 or 5 stars out of 5. Both the seafood crudo appetizers we ordered were fresh, unique, and full of flavor. The burrata with tomatoes and pesto was excellent. I was scooping up every last bit of that dish. I don't usually like raw tomatoes, but these were so fresh and so juicy and so sweet. It was great. I find dishes that make me like food I don't normally like outstanding. The pasta with urchin infused sauce was full of flavor and had lots of seafood. It was originally with penne, but I asked for buccatini because the original shrimp/uni pasta I wanted had buccatini (but they didn't have it anymore). The other tomato sauce seafood pasta we ordered was way too buttery, and we kept saying we should have gone with the squid ink pasta instead. The whole fish (perhaps bronzino but I can't remember) was very well cooked, tender, and flavorful. For dessert, the affogato was forgettable. The little complementary birthday mousse/tart was tasty. But the star was the bomboloni (ricotto doughnuts), which were amazing. They were airy, not dry, slight crunch on the outside, soft on the inside, warm, and went great with the ice cream and sauce that came with it. They were delicious, highly recommended.Sorry if you read that essay. I may give Fiola Mare another try because the food was really very good, but I don't think I'll ever go in the summer again.",3,2,0,0
"Kimberly N.","10/10/2016","Pearland, TX","The scenery was amazing! We were in DC in early May, and every time my boyfriend and I travel somewhere, we always try to go eat somewhere fancy.I'm so happy that we chose Fiola Mare. It was truly fantastic.First, the walk up to the restaurant was spectacular. Nestled by a lake on a boardwalk, Fiola Mare is in the perfect spot for a brunch outside. There's plenty of shade from the DC sun, but sitting outside gave us the opportunity to enjoy the perfect breeze from the lake as well. The service was great from the beginning of the meal to the end. The server was very helpful when asked questions about the brunch and cocktail menus. I got the Spring Cocktail, and it was poured right at the table with a beautiful flower in it. My boyfriend got their Manhattan. They were both delicious. Get the seafood tower! Holy dang, what a variety of fresh seafood! We very much so ate every single bit of it, and it was well worth the price. Oysters, crab, shrimp, and all the sauces that came with it were spectacular.It was perfect. I have no complaints.",5,0,0,0
"Megan H.","10/12/2016","Germantown, MD","Anything that looks good makes you feel better. Fiola Mare looks damn good, especially during dinner service. Doesn't matter if it's pouring buckets upon buckets of rain, there's no spoiling a view of a yacht docked on the Potomac River.The food looks damn good. There's effort put into presentation and it shows. The Under the Sea seafood tower is impressively assembled. Following up that epic tower was the Lobster Ravioli and, well, it's damn near impossible to screw up anything with lobster and cream. Service was puzzling for me, given the typical evening clientele of this restaurant. Staff seemed to interrupt the flow of table conversation frequently, cutting in at inconvenient times. But they meant well, so no harm done. I liked Fiola Mare. I'll be back, but not before I try Fabio Trabocchi's other neighborhood joints.",4,9,0,3
"Buck F.","10/13/2016","Merrifield, Fairfax, VA","Went on a recent Friday evening.  Started at the seating area at the main entrance which was nice.  Excellent Negroni albeit at $16 sorta set the tempo for the rest of the evening.  Obviously a beautiful location on Georgetown water front with place pushing the more fancy experience albeit not maintaining any sort of dress code with people showing up in suits to wearing sweatpants and baseball caps which immediately stood out.We were seated in one of the smaller more intimate dining rooms where the temperature varied from uncomfortably warm to unpleasantly cool.  No consistency.  Menu was a big page of a variety of Italian influenced, seafood themed appetizers, pasta and meat/fish courses at high prices.  One thing that made no sense and stood out was the caviar list priced from $150-240 an ounce.  How Siberian caviar fits with an Italian place was the big question at the table.  On the menu, the waiter was very good at suggesting his 'personal favorites' which interestingly were all the most expensive items on the menu.  Wine list was heavy with very expensive Italian wines and little if any low-medium priced ones so beware or bring your own.Overall, food was well presented, fresh but nothing extraordinary, particularly at those prices.  Checked off our list.",2,1,0,0

"Joy D.","10/19/2016","Washington, DC","I came here for the first time over a year ago, and I've been coming here at least once a month ever since. Friends and family who dine here based on my recommendation all love it as well and many of them are food snobs.Food: I'm on a mostly pescatarian diet, so this place is perfect for me. I love how the menu changes with seasonal ingredients while keeping a few staple items. My favorites are colors of garden and the burrata. Lobster ravioli is also yummy. How can you not love a ravioli that's filled with generous amount of lobster meat?! Currently, my obsession is the risotto with truffle which is new on the fall menu. It's so flavorful and not as heavy as expected, though it can get slightly greasy towards the bottom of the plate. Lobster roll on the lunch menu is delicious too. The lobster is not drenched in the aioli which I much appreciate. I'm not a big bread eater, but I'd always finish my roll, including the warm brioche. One thing my friends and I love as well is the condiments that come with the half shells. The passionfruit (if I remember is correctly) one is refreshing and different. A friend of mine who's extremely picky with her raw bar was talking about it non stop for a week after tasting it.Dessert: I haven't had any desserts that I do not like. I used to order the bombolonis every time I go, but now I'm trying to branch out on some seasonal options and I've been enjoying every single one of them so far.Service: it's top notch! One little thing to keep in mind is occasionally a new staff might be slightly clueless. But there's always first day/week on the job for anyone and I'm sure we can all relate to that. Being said that all the staff is great, if you prefer a super fun and bubbly dining experience, ask for Milad. He's knowledgable and AWESOME!!

It is very pricey but that is OK if the food you get warrants the price. In other words, you should expect the quality of the food to be outstanding. It is good but just not fabulous. My husband, son and I went for my birthday. As  Isaid the staff were marvelous. But we were a bit disappointed in the quality of the food. Perhaps it has been over-hyped, or maybe it was an off night but we have had better fish at other local restaurants and for a lot less money. Please do not interpret this as meaning I never think a good dinner is worth the price. Quite the opposite.I just believe you should get what you pay for and in this case I give an A for ambiance and service and a B for food.

The food was decent but small portions and extra pricey.

It isn't. Maybe it was more saffron than I have had before. I'm sure some may like it, but be sure it is something you are willing to take a bet on.

It wasn't the ask from this high caliber establishment that bothered me. It was the tone. Was also incredibly condescending. As another example, last evening I had dinner and could not find my coat tab after checking it. The hostess was VERY LOUD (and horribly embarrassing in front of my corworkers) in reminding me that I was not welcome while they looked for my coat and that I needed to remain by the exit while they looked.

"Tom B.","11/15/2016","Round Rock, TX","My new favorite restaurant in DC, and one of my favorite seafood restaurants in America! I had a fantastic meal with clients and colleagues here last night. Everyone was really impressed with the food, service and decor.As we walked in we were screened by the Secret Service as it turns out Michello Obama was also there that night for a friends birthday party! We were quickly seated and guided through the menu by our excellent waitress. Then the somelier came over and helped me pick a great bottle of Pinot. We decided to split some Oysters and Scallops with Caviar to start. Both were fantastic, particularly the scallops that tasted fresh from the Ocean with the delicious rich aftertaste of the caviar.I then had the seafood rigatoni which was perfectly portioned and came with a good amount of fish and a nice, tomato sauce to bind it all together. My colleagues had the seabass, monkfish and lobster ravioli respectively and there were 4 very clean plates shortly afterwards.We finished with some house doughnuts and a cheese board which again were demolished. The warm doughnuts in particular were a big hit and came with maple syrup and home made ice cream.I'd highly recommend this as a place to impress a client or for a special occasion with your partner.

"Katherine C.","11/18/2016","Alexandria, VA","My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary at Fiola Mare in Georgetown.  I've been to the Waterfront a few times but had never been here before, so I was excited to add a new restaurant notch in my belt.  Fiola Mare is kind of tucked behind the other restaurants at the Waterfront, but it has a wonderful view of the river, even on a coldish November night, there were tons of people on the patio, enjoying cocktails and the view.My boyfriend planned out what we were going to eat and he totally made the right calls, I was so incredibly pleased with our meal.  To start, we split the burrata salad and one very nice thing is that Fiola Mare split the salad across two plates for us instead of me and my boyfriend awkwardly trying to eat off the plate (maybe that would have been more romantic?).  In all honestly, you can't go wrong with burrata and if burrata is on the menu, I'm gonna eat it.  For pasta, we split the gnocci (also split across two plates).  My family is Italian, but we never had gnocci growing up, so to make up for lost time, whenever I see that on the menu, I order it.  The sauce that the gnocci was in was truly wonderful!  For our main course, we had the Grand Adriatic Grilled Seafood (we were celebrating!) and I'm running out of adjectives, but you might balk at the price, but it was delicious!  We had shrimp, swordfish, langoustine, and a bunch of other seafood that I've forgotten in my post-dinner stupor.  The salsa verde that comes with it was amazing and a wonderful complement for all the seafood (soooo much seafood).  For dessert, we had the bamboloni, which are little fried ricotta doughnuts with a toffee sauce and salted caramel ice cream (so fabulous, save room!).All in all, Fiola Mare is a top notch restaurant for food, and service.  Our waiter truly took care of us, he gave us great recommendations and even comped us some spinach (because we needed a green with our giant seafood dinner!) as well as complimentary glasses of a dessert wine which we forgot the name of (sooooo much food!).  The waitstaff explained the dishes to us and made sure we were really taken care of.  I'd totally recommend this for people looking for a really upscale experience.",5,0,0,1
"Vivian L.","11/18/2016","Georgetown, Washington, DC","Fiola Mare', not to be confused with the Michelin Star restaurant, ""Fiola"", is a large restaurant on the Georgetown Waterfront, which serves Italian and seafood, craft cocktails, and has a big wine selection. I've been coming here on and off since it opened. I like it mostly for its location: very close to my house, on the waterfront, and next to Georgetown Park. Tip: Sit on the veranda when it's nice out, or enjoy a cocktail in their semi outside lounge area in the front of restaurant.  Service- Always quick to be sat. Table service is sometimes a bit slow and unorganized, but otherwise, good service. The management always does a fine job, and is professional. Atmosphere- A few different open rooms you can be sat in. I have occasionally gotten a factory type of vibe when dining. Many smiles and greetings when you walk in. Love that they open the door for you. Modern, cozy bar in the front. Friendly waiters/waitresses. Cocktails- Extensive wine list. Craft cocktails, that are good, but not amazing. Fiola Mare's cocktails are about the same price as The Dabney's, except The Dabney uses more creative ingredients, uses fancier glasses, and the over taste is better.Food- Food was good probably the first 9 months it was open. Now I would rate the food 2/5. I was there a few weeks ago with a party, and we ordered pretty much everything on the menu, except steak and the large seafood dishes. None of us really liked our meal, despite trying almost everything. There was nothing that stood out to me in a good way. We sent back the gnocchi because it was inedible. Overall: Good restaurant for summer or winter. Happy, lively environment. Good for small groups, friends, family dinners. Probably too large or a restaurant for an intimate date.That's all for now.

"Ashley L.","11/21/2016","Centreville, VA","I have to be honest, we were disappointed in our experience at Fiola Mare. I think part of it was the fact we had an amazing experience at Fiola a couple of years ago and had high expectations going in. It was our one year anniversary, and we got married in Italy on the Amalfi coast. So needless to say, we were super excited to visit an Italian seafood restaurant to celebrate our special day. The service was great, no complaints there. My major complaint is that the quality of food was just ""ok"". We tried numerous dishes: tuna tartare app, buratta app, two pasta dishes, the seafood grill platter, and desert. I think we got enough to be able to assess the quality. The best thing we had in my opinion was the branzino on the seafood platter- it was seriously amazing. The other food was just not up to par for what we were expecting. And paying. For the money we spent (close to $500 including our bar tab before the meal for two drinks) we expect to be impressed and excited.

"Nalini M.","12/4/2016","Washington, DC","If you want seafood with delicious wines in an elegant setting then Fiola Mare is the place to go!  Personally I love the food but the wine has  me hook, line and sinker.  A fantastic experience on all 7  times that  I have been there (yes I know I know this review is long overdue).  Let's start with cocktails... a personal fave is the Forbitten  - with calvados, cocchi americano, a habanero syrup and laphroaig to give it a tad but of smokiness - yum!     Dinner last night was heaven - we did splurge on caviar .. good sevruga which to me is just melt in the mouth yumminess!  We followed this with something I always get - the ahi tuna carpaccio... fresh tuna can't be beat!  I have to say the presentation of all the meals adds a flair to the delicious flavors presented.  My friend ended up with the Seafood Brodetto (monkfish, langoustine, clams and branzino and octopus) and i settled for the Duck breast.  (On past occasions i have gone straight to the truffle risotto which beyond bar is simply divine.. melt in the mouth comfort).   Ending our meal with the chocolate and pear tart and some fine cognac.  Perfection.  This is one of my favourite places for an intimate meal - with a marvelous view of the water. The service is stellar, the ambiance perfect and when one is with good company, it's an experience.  I've realized after last night that I really need to come here more often!!",4,0,0,0

Both experiences were exceptional. The lobster ravioli was so good the first time that I couldn't venture off and had to get it a second time. It did not disappoint. Had some kind of oyster appetizer which was a really unexpected presentation, but delicious flavors. Bartender brought us a dessert to try, can't remember which one, but it was worth every bite.

I had the seafood platter. The uni, tuna tartare and wakame salad I thought were delicious and fresh. Besides that, everything else was decent.

"Path H.","12/29/2016","Falls Church, VA","Can't sing enough praises for this restaurant. We have been here for brunch about 3 times and dinner 1 time and always had a memorable dining experience. FOOD:  The $45 brunch option is worth it!  Includes bread, cocktail/mocktail, antipasti or dessert and entree. Their strengths are seafood pastas and desserts. The ricotta donuts are our boys' favorites. They change up the sauces to dip it with and the gelato that comes with it. For the holidays it came with a gingerbread gelato that was superb. I don't drink but never had a bad mocktail. For our boys, the kitchen have been always able to make pasta with fresh pomodoro sauce. My youngest son is super picky and he gobbled up two plates. SERVICE:  The team here are so well trained and it shows. The servers are knowledgeable and not pushy. Everything is well orchestrated.  You have about 4 people assigned to your table making sure your drinks are filled and your table is cleared. ATMOSPHERE: The dining room is polished, but not stuffy. We have been lucky to be seated with a view of the water several times. The noise level is not too loud. COST: For a family of 4, we usually spend about $350 including tip. We also pay for parking nearby which is about another $12-16. Because it's pricey, we eat here for special occasions.",5,0,0,0

"David M.","1/2/2017","Washington, DC","Knowing full well we couldn't trust ourselves to eat moderately during our new years day brunch at Fiola Mare, my wife and I chose to eat very light for breakfast that morning, and then to walk to Georgetown for that extra bit of exercise before we feasted. In hindsight, this may not have been the best idea. By the time we got half way there, we were both full on hangry, and to top it off, a bird decided to leave a lovely new embellishment on my wife's nice coat. At this point, it took all we could muster just to make it to the restaurant, but I'm happy to say we persevered. Once there, the front desk asked if we'd like to check out coats, which we politely declined, telling the poor woman way more than she wanted to hear about my wife's ""good"" fortune on the walk over. No more than a few minutes later, one of the floor managers approached us with champagne flutes, making light of the situation and apologizing for the circumstances. He was even able to track down a bag for my wife to carry her coat in until we got home. These little gestures completely redeemed our New Years. I want to take another moment to thank the staff members for their thoughtfulness!Now, if that whole bit wasn't enough, the food is outrageous. I got the $45 brunch with burrata, duck ragu, and doughnuts for dessert. I was sure nothing would beat the duck ragu, until I tried some of my wife's branzino. Everything was so delicious, we both commented on how we wouldn't mind going back again today!There's no question why this place won a Michelin star. The service and food were both perfect.",5,0,0,1
"Simmy H.","1/2/2017","Alpharetta, GA","This restaurant gets five stars for service! We came here for New Year's Day brunch. We actually almost skipped the place because we were a little turned off by how they require a credit card to make a reservation, but I'm glad we didn't. First the restaurant and its location are gorgeous! The decor is maritime without being cheesy. We didn't get to sit by a window, but I did have an awesome view of the kitchen food prep and fish. Next time though I definitely want to ask about sitting by the water because those views look incredible. The atmosphere at brunch is perfect- lively, happy and the restaurant is full of natural sunlight. My girlfriend got the three course brunch, which comes with an additional pastry basket (amazing- so flaky, buttery and fresh) and free cocktail. It's a good deal. I got an entree and a drink. We split everything and were totally stuffed by the end. The brunch cocktails are solid, and we loved that there were so many to choose from. Our server guided us patiently through the menu. The only disappointment was that they had run out of something we had wanted to order. They more than made up for it by making us feel really valued and special. We got several free things added to our meal simply because we commented that we enjoyed something or because our server thought it would be a add-on that would complement a dish well.

"Victoria H.","1/7/2017","Seattle, WA","I came here at 5 pm before the dinner crowd and got a table with a view of the polluted Potomac River, which looks quite calm in the dark back drop of winter and traffic lights. The service here was so wonderful with an attentive server who came at the right moments to take our order, refill our free bread, and clear our plates. She made everything on the menu sound decadent. I ordered a delicious champagne drink ($16) and a side of sweet potato cream, which I should warn is spicy with a lot of paprika on the top ($10) and a ravioli with black truffles ($30). The entree sauce was so delicious, I used the free bread to take in every last drop of that sauce. The sweet potato crema had great texture and a sweet/savory taste--the perfect side dish for the seafood if you're used to eating that with rice since they don't serve rice here. The bar area looks so sleek with white leather bar chairs and a nicely lit bar. I do think it's overpriced, but you pay for location, service, and ambience.

"Michael L.","1/7/2017","Seattle, WA","I took my lady out to this restaurant because I was looking for an Italian place that had good ambiance and great tasting Italian food. I've been to filomena's just down the street which had fairly decent tasting and comforting Italian food at slightly cheaper prices, so I was a little skeptical about Fiola and if I was going to be paying a higher price for mediocre Italian food. In reading previous reviews I decided we should give this place a shot. I ordered a half order of their signature lobster ravioli and for $28 was served two small stuffed ravioli's with 1 lobster pincer. I kept thinking about the early 80's commercial of that old lady saying, ""Where's the beef?"" The portion size for the half order price was disappointing. I had to fill myself up with their house bread which I dipped in olive oil and balsamic just so I wouldn't have to go elsewhere after dinner to get more food to satisfy me. The food WAS good, don't get me wrong. But the price just doesn't justify what you get. And don't give me that crap about ""I'm paying for ambiance and atmosphere"". If I wanted that, I could have stayed home cooked a nice trader Joes pizza, lit a few candles, poured myself a few glasses of white wine, and called it a night...all for under $12",3,0,0,0
"Jennifer L.","1/8/2017","Herndon, VA","I really, really was looking forward to dining here. They are one of the few handful of restaurants that received a Michelin Star in DC. I was craving the frutti de mare platter and arrived for brunch on a Sunday. Shockingly, upon arrival, my party of four was completely ignored by the hostess. No worries, we saw free seats at the bar so we sat down. There was one menu on the bar so the four of us had to share until I asked for more menus.  We finally order and the food comes out. There was some mix up with all of our orders but we sorted it out. Food: fishy (implied not fresh) seafood. Very disappointing Service: Meanwhile, the bar seat next to my party was reserved for one person. She arrived, and the bartenders gave her all the attention and ignored my party. And we were ignored upon arrival and had to ask for menus so service, in my opinion, was sub par.When it came time to get the tab, I had to flag down another bartender. I asked for a box and he said no it's against policy. He proceeds to flag down my bartender and ask if I can box up my items that I paid for. My bartender, who was busy flirting with the female customer, shakes his head no. He then tells me that the restaurant prohibits boxing shellfish. Fine by me, just wished there was some disclaimer about it. By this point, we were ready to leave anyway.Not exactly sure of what the hype is about this place, but I feel that patrons should be warned that food and service wasn't that great.

"Katy L.","1/23/2017","Beverly Hills, CA","Was hoping for this to be another jewel in the Trabocchi crown but the staff was such a disappointment we will never return.  Upon arrival, one cannot help but be taken aback by the glittering and gorgeous bar only to have all hopes of civility dashed by an intentionally rude and angry wait-staff. Queries to the menu were rebuffed to the point that we gave up asking, closed the menu and said, fine, what oysters do you have? The response: they are listed in the menu (you idiot). Things only spiralled downward from there and so I felt no reason to hold off asking, why is it we have bread plates and olive oil? Apparently bread is brought after the main course-or maybe they intentionally didn't bring it.  What managers don't know, is we don't want to make an already painful evening- even more work by complaining, especially when clearly this level of insolence is tolerated and condoned. We had complained somewhat earlier when the only logical solution would have been to change our server but they made us suffer on. I blame myself for not leaving then. Was truly MY WORST DINING EXPERIENCE IN DC.

"Laurie W.","1/26/2017","Vienna, VA","It's been over 2 years since my last visit to Fiola Mare (so many restaurants to explore in Washington!) but I am pleased to say that my experience last night was just as good as the last time I was there - maybe even better. It's still pricey, sure - but I still hold that it's worth every penny.On a random, balmy 60-degree day in January, my husband and I decided to take advantage of the nice weather and decided to meet at Fiola Mare for al fresco drinks and then dinner. It was a gorgeous evening, and when we arrived (on a Wednesday) I was surprised to see that the patio was empty (and thankfully open). We settled in on the couch, took in the view, grabbed one of the blankets, and ordered some drinks. My husband loved his mezcal based drink, and I had two sparkling wine drinks and both were delicious. We sat out there for about an hour or so - service was good up until the end, when our bartender didn't come back for about 20 minutes and we had to get up and head into the restaurant for our reservation. The bar was busy by that point (place was empty when we arrived, but a steady stream of customers arrived as we were out on the porch), so he probably just got busy.I'd requested a table with a view of the water and they sat us at a very nice two top next to the large windows. Our server - I forget her name - was excellent. We were originally going to order the tuna tartare, but were also salivating over the pastas. She gave us some tips on what to order - not just dish-wise but amount-of-food wise, which was great and very much appreciated. We ended up ordering the scorpionfish risotto, which they split into two portions for us. The pasta was a perfect texture and the seafood that accompanied it was fantastic. My husband ended up ordering the simply grilled branzino, which came with a lovely Italian-style tomato sauce, and I had the brodetto, which was just a bowl chock-full of various seafood (langoustine, clams, octopus - you name it - it was in there) and finished with a delicious red wine sauce that went absolutely beautifully. We didn't order any sides (we were thinking if we were still hungry we'd order dessert) but were brought a gratis dish of the white beans with rosemary and ham - they were delicious. In addition, our server also made great wine recommendations - she suggested a syrah that went beautifully with my dish and gave my husband two whites to try with his. Since we got the beans, we were actually too full for dessert, but two mini tiramisu-like pudding dishes appeared! I couldn't believe they also gave us a dessert on top of the side dish! No idea if those comps are normal, but they were without a doubt above and beyond and much appreciated.Great place for a special occasion...or heck, a random Wednesday if you're looking for fabulous seafood with a view.",5,2,0,0

"Veronica K.","2/3/2017","Washington, DC","This was my third visit to Fiola Mare and by far my favorite - the Restaurant Week lunch menu was perfect! Both suggested wines paired well with our meals and were delicious, even though it wasn't what we normally gravitate towards. We enjoyed our appetizers, with the Vellutata soup being the standout. The beet salad was a little bit salty (I never add salt to anything...) but I still enjoyed it and it wasn't a deterrent towards the enjoyment of the meal. We both got the branzino for our entrees, which was generously portioned and the mussels in it really added some good flavor. For dessert, we got the bombolini donuts with caramel sauce (my favorite - although I do like the chocolate sauce that normally accompanies it) and the hazelnut flan. The restaurant was extremely well-staffed and service was impeccable as always. Overall, I think the raw bar, desserts (bombolini, in particular) and service are the standouts here - even on non-RW visits.

As many times as I've eaten their divine seafood cuisine, they have never missed the mark with a dish... No matter brunch, lunch, or dinner on any day of the week. You know the food is amazing, service is perfection, and their ambiance is stellar from all of their rave reviews so I won't get into those things again.This review is a shout out for their NYE celebration. Hubby surprised me with dinner reservations at Fiola Mare for NYE 2016 & while I've been a number of times to celebrate our personal special occasions, this was my first visit for a holiday dinner. I must admit I was skeptical & worried about the food quality and service being subpar, as I have found at other restaurants on holidays. NOT. THE. CASE. AT. ALL. FOR. FIOLA MARE. I can not express thoroughly enough how on point the staff was. We were running late for our 10:00pm reservation time and were accommodated with no hassle at all & still treated like royalty and like the only guests in the restaurant during our entire meal. There were great decorations that were festive while not cheesy. The entire management staff was mingling and checking in on tables frequently. We were given party hats and blowers for when the clock struck midnight. There was also complimentary Veuve Cliquot champagne being given out along with a great live band. Hands down the best NYE date ever. I felt like I was at a party from the Great Gatsby in an amazing way. I'm not a huge fan of big loud crowds or clubs so this was right up my alley and the perfect way to bring in the New Year on an incredibly romantic note. We may make their NYE dinner an annual tradition going forward.",5,8,0,4

"Lin W.","2/14/2017","Great Hills, Austin, TX","This is what you would expect from a fancy restaurant with pricey tag. Food is decent and servers are friendly. The main knock on them is customer service. My mom in law left her reading glasses behind so I called to check whether they have it by chance. They only have people over the phone to take reservation and the girl said she would pass the message to management. We waited patiently but nobody bothered to call us back. So we decided to swing by and the glasses is sitting on host's desk. Kudos to them for keeping it for us but I called multiple times and their so-called management never bothered to return my call! I would have gone back if not for this kind of lack of care for your customer but there are too many options with great customer service",2,0,0,0
"Rachel B.","2/16/2017","Clarksville, MD","On Valentine's Day we had 930 reservations. We showed up at 9:15. Check in was a mess, no one asked to take our coats and we were told to wait at the bar, which we did and weren't sat until 10:15!!! Not a word of apology from a manager for this delay. At almost 10:30 We had to beg for service to order food. We chose a 4 course tasting with premium wine pairing which was very unorganized, the plates were some of the least visually appealing I have seen, the sommelier gave weak and rushed descriptions with more than once us having to ask to see the wine label. I can only assume that staff was to tired to provide us with the experience we reserved and ultimately paid for but didn't receive. I was 99% displeased with this place. The 1% saving grace was Ryan at the bar who entertained us for our 45 minute wait for our reservation to be honored. Sadly we won't be back to this restaurant, this isn't how a professional organization should be run. I would like to compare this experience to one at perhaps a Cheesecake Factory, however even Cheesecake Factory would have provided better execution.",1,0,0,0

"Fontaine C.","2/19/2017","Clayton, MO","Perfect location - right by the Georgetown harbour. Attentive service. High quality dishes. All of these factors allow me to rate Flore Mare very highly during my visit in D.C.There are a number of dishes we ordered:To start, we chose crab peekytoe as appetizer. It is one of the specials for tonight. Love it using chunky crab meat, topped with caviar; and accompanied with spinach sauce. It is very light and appetizing. Definitely set the right tone for our seafood course.Our second course is the lobster ravioli. This dish is highly recommended. This is my favorite of the night. I enjoy the extremely thin wrapper wrapped with lobster claw. I completely savoured the sauce - similar to lobster bisque. We couldn't help licking the plate, as the sauce was SO good!!Our third dish is a seafood brodetto. This dish has a mixture of three types of fish, shrimps and clams. The presentation is beautiful. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy the sauce as much as the lobster ravioli. I feel the chef can refine the saltiness or taste of the sauce briefly to elevate the dish.Our dinner ended with a dessert, named Bomboloni. It comes with 4 pieces of lemon flavored donut, syrups and a brown sugar gelato. This dish was highly recommended by fellow yelpers. We do enjoy this very much too. I feel the lemon taste (from the donut) goes very well with the gelato.I love this place. I am confident you will feel the same.",5,1,0,0
"Sue K.","2/20/2017","Springfield, VA","Worth the price except for the lobster ravioli. I was confused when the server said he had split the plate for us because each plate had one ravioli and half of a shrimp sized lobster tail. Exactly what was there to split?The oysters on the other hand were probably the best I've had in a long time. So fresh and the sauce on the side goes perfectly with the oysters. We ordered the whole fish and the seasoning was perfect for the bass. It had a hint of rosemary and thyme that flavored it so well.",4,1,0,0
"Daisy D.","2/25/2017","Washington, DC","I very rarely write reviews, but this was such an amazing experience that I just had to.  I took my best friend here for her bday and I think I made a note when I made the reservation.  Normally restaurants look at the note and just say happy birthday. But here, aside from just the amazing service, at end of the meal, we got a complimentary dessert wine. Which was already amazing.  Then we got a complimentary dessert on top of what we ordered. Then another birthday dessert on the house.  She also got a birthday card and many happy birthdays from everyone who served us.It was really the best service we've had in years!",5,1,0,1
"Rich S.","3/1/2017","Washington, DC","Can I give 6 stars? It is expensive and absolutely worth it. Lobster ravioli divine. Fish tower starter--fresh fresh fresh. Get it.

"Jane W.","3/2/2017","San Francisco, CA","My boyfriend took me here for Saturday brunch a couple weekends ago and I had an overall fantastic experience. -- THE FOOD --We were browsing the menu for a while before agreeing to share the Ancona seafood platter ($85) between the two of us, and ordering more food after as needed. It was estimated to serve 2-3 and the waitress informed us that although it is technically an appetizer, the portion size is substantial enough that it could potentially satisfy us both. The Ancona came with oysters, clams, steamed mussels, lobster, tiger prawns, sea urchin on seaweed salad, sea scallop, king crab, langoustines, and tuna tartar. A few things to note: - I liked how the oysters were fresh, mild, and not briny (I liked them a lot and I'm usually not a fan of oysters). - The langoustines were noticeably creamy which was unexpected but pleasant. - One thing I did not like was the pairing of the sea urchin with the seaweed salad. I personally am not a huge fan of sea urchin so I didn't mind too much, but the strong flavors of the seaweed overpowered the delicate flavors of the sea urchin. - The mussels were also mediocre (relative to how fresh and delicious the other seafood is)Overall, the seafood was very fresh and it was fun and engaging to share the platter with someone else. Everything came in pairs/even numbers, so we would pick which seafood to eat next and try it together. I also really appreciated the warm towels with thyme (?) they gave us after the meal.We were satisfied after the Ancona (although not full), so we decided to end the meal with dessert. We opted for the Bombolini ($14) which came with Sardinian Ricotta Doughnuts, Maple Caramel, and Cinnamon Gelato. Definitely recommend! It wasn't too sweet and the doughnuts were served warm. Overall a great contrast in flavors, textures, and temperatures. -- SERVICE AND INTERIOR --Service was friendly, polite, and efficient. It was very crowded when I went, but it was a nice space with potential window-side seating. Great for both a more casual, treat-yourself kind of meal, as well as a more formal date/meal.Verdict: great experience! Can't speak to their other food but I was overall very satisfied with what I ordered.",5,3,1,2

The 3 course by brunch meal was absolutely delicious and filling! The service was phenomenal! The spaghetti had the perfect texture! The lemon ricotta pancakes had the perfect amount of sweetness and the cod with broth is recommended if you want something to dip the bread basket goodies with. The waitress over heard us talking about the birthday celebration and then they brought out champagne and a birthday dessert for the birthday boy! I can't stop raving about this beautiful restaurant!

"Jing L.","3/6/2017","Marietta, GA","First the location of this restaurant is great, just right by the water, you can enjoy the beautiful view while eating. Second, they have the BEST service. You don't have to ask for more water or bread or anything, they can read your mind and gave to you before you ask. We ordered Crab Peekytoe, Seafood Brodetto, Lobster ravioli, Bomboloni 1. Crab Peekytoe: This is an appetizer. Even though it's small size, but worth the prize. It's sliced crab meat with caviar on top, green bean leaves as decoration. The caviar match crab meat perfectly, not too salty. 2. Lobster ravioli: this is my favorite dish. Lobster is so good! The skin of ravioli is thin and has full flavor, and inside ravioli is also lobster meat. The best of best is the source of the dish, very tasty. We tried to use bread to dip the source, turned out surprisingly good. I highly recommend this dish.3. Seafood Brodetto: it's mixed of three different types of fish, scallops, squid, shrimp, and clam. The source is dark and taste a little bitter. I never tried this flavor before, so it's taste wired for me. Not taste bad, just I don't like it.4. Bomboloni: This is desert recommended by our waitress. It come with donut balls, warm sugar syrup, and vanilla ice cream. The donuts is crisp outside and soft inside. I ate it with syrup and put ice cream on top, taste sweet but not greasy because of ice cream. This desert is really worth to try. Overall I love this restaurant a lot, not only the service and also the food are very good. It's a little pricy, but with the environment and service, I would like to come back again.",5,0,0,0
"Jenny W.","3/10/2017","Bethesda, MD","It was the best experience ever! I wanted to surprise my best friend for her birthday so I made a reservation and told the restaurant about my plans. They made everything so easy! The staff at Fiola Mare were more than accommodating. They gave the birthday girl a night she will remember for the rest of her life! Food wise, I'm a little bit scared when going to a seafood restaurant because I'm very sensitive to the quality of seafood, anything that isn't fresh will result in immediate health problems. Last night, I knew my best friend's family enjoys seafood so I chose Fiola Mare thinking that ""what the hack, it's a chance I am willing to take.""

Hubs and I were celebrating our anniversary here and right away they greeted us, seated us, and wished us a Happy Anniversary. Our server was very nice and very attentive the entire evening and other staff would also walk by to make sure everything was going well through out the night.  We ordered the raw bar platter as an appetizer and WOW. It was huge! Oysters, clams, mussels, crab legs, shrimp, prawns, lobster, tuna tartare, and UNI! We were almost full after that but we had more coming.We ordered the spaghetti with clams. Fiola Mare offers half portions on their pasta dishes which is great since we didn't really want that much pasta and only wanted to sample. It was SO delicious. It was rich in flavor and I enjoyed everything. I could have licked the bowl for the sauce. The other nice part was that they knew we were sharing so they already divided our pasta into our own dishes.Next was the Branzino and a side of warm corn and Farro salad. The fish was cooked perfectly and the corn and Farro salad was delicious. They also gave us an extra side of the spinach and I thought that was very nice of them. The spinach was really great too. I actually liked it more than the corn and farro. Then our server brings us a few little desserts on the house!  They were so cute and very tasty. She also gave us a happy anniversary card too and I thought that was a very touch. Our bill came down to around 200$ which I thought was really good considering how much food we got and we also had a half bottle of wine too. I would definitely come back here again!  One of the best restaurants in DC!",5,2,1,1
"Richard K.","3/19/2017","New York, NY","I mean the only thing  not to like of this place is that it was   raining outside! The staff is just a breath if fresh air. Young, kind, courteous and knowledgeable. It made me feel not too out of place because i was underdressed in my adidas t shirt. I dont drink so can only judge the food. I ordered the lobster ravioli. $40 You get two pieces of ravioli and a chunck of lobster in a creamy sauce. Delicious. I tasted the calamari of my table partner and in all honesty the best octopus i have EVER eaten! In NYC it is always gummi and chewy. This is soft as butter and so supertasty in the garlicky sauce. Damn who is that in the kitchen? GOD HIMSELF?! lol anyway. The three pieces of gelato couldve been a bit more special. $14 i expected some of the exotic tastes they offered with the other deserts. But the tiramisu was i believe also made by angels !! Because my guests just wouldnt stop praising it. Plus it looked like the Taj Mahal on their plate! Anyway no wonder the Obamas come here.

A transcendent pinot.  Perigord Black Truffle Risotto -- If you love risotto and truffle, as I do, you'll love this dish. Shaved black truffle. Need I say more?Spanish Turbot Fillet -- Delicate flavor, soft fillet. If you're used to firm fish, you may want to skip this. I found it delicious, though.

The menu was uninspiring, the food was lackluster, and the service was not on par with an establishment of this caliber. Our waitress was barely knowledgeable about the menu and never came back after we ordered our food, until the very end of the meal after we had expressed our displeasure with the manager. The food was lukewarm at best, after taking at least 40 minutes to arrive. After expressing our concern about the barely warm food, our service then became jumbled and confusing. We waited at least 15 minutes after asking for the check for anyone to even acknowledge us. In the end, the manager apologized profusely and comped our meal, which was unnecessary but appreciated.

Not only did the hosts not blink an eye or shame us, they wished us happy anniversary and immediately took us to our table, which had a lovely view of the Potomac river. The menu also has ""Happy Anniversary"" printed on it. The wait staff gave us 5-star service! They offered sparkling or still water and had no air of superiority when we asked for tap water. Always polite, helpful and kind. I ordered prosecco; my husband ordered a glass of red wine. The pours were generous, which is great considering the price per glass. We decided to splurge, since it was our 5 year anniversary, so we each ordered an appetizer, entree and dessert. I had the composition of blue fin tuna; my husband had the ahi tuna carpaccio. Both were beautifully composed, complex in flavor and so worth it! I had hoped to try the champagne caviar oyster, but it wasn't on the menu that night. For entrees, I had the lobster ravioli, and my husband had the black truffle risotto. The lovser ravioli was 2 large raviolis and generous tail and claw lobster meat in a sauce that was essentially essence of lobster. I loved it! My husband's risotto was perfect and had the most shaved black truffle either of us had ever seen in our lives. Rich and earthy in flavor. It was unforgettable. For dessert, I ordered the dark chocolate pate-- rich and dark, as I craved. My husband ordered the tiramisu, which was light, fluffy and tasted perfect. They also brought us a special off the menu dessert--a chocolate hazelnut cake and these housemade grapefruit gel candies! Delicious!

I booked a reservation ahead of times to treat my husband to a nice early anniversary dinner and by looking at all the reviews this place was the way to go.Atmosphere- I don't understand how people are complimenting this place. It's like dinning at a Cheesecake Factory. It's so loud and the tables are so crowded you are literally eating with everyone sitting around you. Zero intimacy or elegance.Food- my husband enjoyed his grill dish and said it was good. The Anacona was somewhat disappointing. Uni was tiny like quarter of what you would get in one uni sushi, tuna tar tar had no flavor no sauce.  The sauce they brought out was all blend. I asked for horse radish for the oysters and clam because the sauces did not go with either of them.Service- you literally get the servers ass in your face when they are attaining other common customers. Doesn't help that the table next to you has 50 questions about the wine selection.  Our server was ok but for the price he could have been more attentive. We got better attention from the server name Pedro who came by our table to pour the water or take out the piling shells on the plate.Cocktails- I ordered 3 grey goose cosmopolitan and it was all way too citrusy and the taste was never consistent. For $19 cocktail I expected more.I usually don't write a review unless I feel like what most people are saying here can possibly disappoint someone going off the review.

We had an 11:00 reservation, and were seated in the main area away from the windows. My mother and I both opted for the Fiola Mare Signature Brunch, a prix fixe option.  We received a basket of pastries with our prix fixe, and everything contained within was outstanding.  We then had our choice of antipasti, main course, and dessert.  Between the two of us, we feasted like kings.  We split a sort of torta with delicious ham and arugla (the official name of which escapes me), and burrata for an antipasti.  Our waiter surprised us with their house-smoked cod as an appetizer as well.  For our main course, I had the UOVA in CAMICIA, their amazing take on an eggs benedict.  I could eat this everyday, but I do wish that I had been more adventurous in retrospect.  My mother ordered the GRAGNANO SPAGHETTI alla GRANSEOLA, basically a spaghetti marinara with crab.  However, this dish is so much more than the sum of its parts and my explanation of it does it no justice.  Every thing that left the kitchen was flawless. Our waiter took amazing care of us, giving us a free dessert as well. Their pastry chef is outstanding, and I would've liked to personally shake their hand after this.

Seafood is the name of the game here, and everything we had was extremely fresh and well prepared. So if you're looking for many, non-seafood options, go elsewhere.

Make sure to get the full fish, as they debone it in front of you. However, the restaurant is kind of dark so I'm not sure how well the Snapchat/Instagram social media crusade will play out here. Sorry :(The Tiramisu and complimentary strawberry mousse thing was one of my favorite parts. I love the explanations they give when they hand out the dessert. You always do this ""nod"" and half-smile like you are really soaking all that dessert-related vernacular they're throwing at you. Yum. The ambience is dark. Dark meaning that it seems the fancier the restaurant, the more a restaurant is unable to afford proper lighting. You all know what I'm talking about. This is good because it hides imperfections on my skin. Which is contrary to those mirrors they have at hotels that blow your skin up and you can see every single pore and spend 20 minutes at wit's end about how your life got to be this way.The service was also lovely! It started off a bit slow as I think they were having a night where the waitress said ""everyone came in at once"". However, it picked up throughout the evening and the waitress was friendly and attentive.There are plenty of pictures on here so you can eat with your eyes before you enter the restaurant.

From appetizers to entrees to desserts! Earned a solid 10 and that's a very hard score to come by in our book. We will come back to D.C. Just for this restaurant. The view of the river doesn't hurt as well. Fabulous!!",5,0,0,0

Ordered the following (Everything was phenomenal):  Crabcake - waiter told us that it was gluten free. (they don't use breadcrumbs for fillers aka, more crab meat)  Gragnano Spaghetti alla Granseola (Alaskan King Crab, San Marzano Tomatoes, Parsley) - We actually ordered this dish twice.

"Jo K.","4/21/2017","Bowie, MD","Brunch review only! Great place for brunch. One star off for the price and lack of bottomless mocktails/cocktails as advertised. It was $60-$70 for each of us so this is certainly one of the pricier options for brunch. However the food and the AMAZING bread basket won us over. They are also able to accommodate changes to my chosen items easily due to dietary restrictions such as the eggs needed to be cooked, items separated etc. EVERYTHING we had tasted fantastic!!!The only issue we had was that the mocktails AND cockails that we ordered came SOOO late every time that we ordered it that I was only able to order two the entire meal! I at least wanted to try each one to see which was my favorite and there just wasn't enough time to do that because of the slow rate of beverage service. We'd go again but maybe complain this time if the drinks are coming at the same slooooow rate.",4,0,0,0

"Roya B.","4/23/2017","Rocklin, CA","BRUNCH REVIEWMy boyfriend and I came here for an early Valentine's Day brunch (Valentine's day was on a Tuesday).It was our first time here, although we had previously dined at their sister restaurants, Fiola & Casa Luca. We did restaurant week at both and thought Casa Luca was amazing.Anyway, we thought the best way to try a bunch of things while on a budget would be to visit for their brunch, which includes 3-courses and 1 alcoholic beverage (mimosa, sangria, or bloody mary) for $45 pp (oh, and a complimentary pastry basket to start).  For me, a lightweight, I prefer a brunch that focuses on the quality of the food rather than bottomless mimosas with crappy champagne.On to the experience: we arrived right on time for our reservations and were offered coat check and seated promptly. Unfortunately, we were taken to one of the only areas of the restaurant that did not have a river view. I wouldn't have minded so much, but it was a beautifully sunny day and it would have been nice to have a view (- 1/2 star). On that note, I would like to return in the summer because they have a lot of outdoor seating and hopefully we can increase our chances of getting that view ;-) Other than the view issue, the setting is great for an intimate meal, as the tables are spaced well, and the volume was not a problem.As for service, our waiter was very professional and there were several bussers that brought our food/cleaned the table, etc., throughout the meal. What I did not like was that our pastry basket came out after our first course (-1/2 star). I'm usually not that picky but this place is supposed to be the #1 restaurant in DC, so I expect the very best.Finally, as for the food- amazing. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, and we enjoyed it all. The pasta dishes are phenomenal, as is the seafood. Very high quality with beautiful presentation. Overall, great place to dine for brunch. Looking forward to returning, and I will be requesting a table with a view in my next reservation!",4,6,0,1

"Christine S.","4/28/2017","Irvine, CA","On the way to Fiola Mare, our uber driver pointed us to the place where they filmed a part of The Exorcist. The ""Exorcist stairs"" are located at the corner of Prospect Street NW and 36th Street NW. I've never watched the movie because it seemed too creepy, but it's always fun learning random facts about places! Last year, Washingtonian named Fiola Mare the #1 restaurant in the city. This year, it dropped to #5, but it's definitely still one of the #1 restaurants in my book! The dining room is romantic and modern, and I was glad they sat us by the windows looking out at the water.We started off our lunch with cocktails: He got the Sapore Vero (rye whiskey, carpano bianco vermouth, amaro montengero, and luxardo maraschino), and I got the Riviera (grapefruit and rosemary infused vodka, limoncello, campari granita, and sparkling rose). Our server wasn't joking when he said their cocktails are really good! Besides their featured cocktails, they offer mocktails and the classic cocktails. After our server recommended some of his favorite dishes on the menu, we spent quite a while trying to figure out just what we should order. When we started ordering, our server laughed and said, ""Ah, you guys look like Californians. You guys look like you really enjoy food."" True that!- One of the items we ordered was the 3 course Maria Menu. The appetizer was this heirloom Italian radicchio with citrus, fennel, pecorino, and anchovy dressing. If all salads tasted like this, I could definitely eat salads every day!- This Fiola Mare lobster ravioli was one of the stars of lunch. Unlike usual ravioli with thick skin and not a lot of meat, the ravioli here had an abundant amount of lobster in the filling. And they also gave two extra pieces of lobster on the side. Happy taste buds, for sure!- Duck egg raviolo with braised beef cheek, truffled ricotta, and brasato sauce. Once we cut into this raviolo, the egg yolk flowed out perfectly.- After we ate the ravioli, we were served with our seafood. The olive oil poached Norwegian cod with chickpea crema, rapini, taggisaca olives, and berganot was the main dish in the Maria Menu. The fish melted in your mouth, and the sauce complemented the fish really well. We also ordered a pound of grilled calamari. They only serve them by the pound, so we almost didn't order it... but so glad we did! We've never had grilled calamari this tender before. It was so tender we had to ask how they cooked it. The secret was boiling it a little before putting it on the grill. Doubt I'd ever try it since I don't cook much, but it's good to know how it's done! Our server also gave us some spinach on the house!After we finished our cocktails, Phil ordered us some wine to go with our seafood. He sure enjoys in the finer things in life! I was surprised we finished all of our food. And for dessert from the Maria Menu, we got the garden strawberries and mint dish. Our server not only gave us an extra portion so we didn't have to share, he also gave us two glasses of dessert wine and a chocolate hazelnut bite. This guy really does know his food - the dessert wine paired perfectly with the dessert!Our first meal in DC was phenomenal, and the bar was definitely set pretty high. Would any meal after be able to top this? We hope so...",5,5,2,2

"Amber C.","4/28/2017","Manassas, VA","I went to lunch yesterday with a few of my other lady coworkers for Admin Professionals Day. I'd been bracing myself for an expensive lunch after looking at the menu prices before visiting. Do I want to starve myself and be cheap and eat wilted spinach? Or do I want to splurge? This was my first time at the restaurant and I'm not a huge seafood fan but I could still appreciate these dishes. My coworker ordered the Tuna tartare which I sampled. It was very tasty, nothing like I expected it to taste and it went well with the bread they served. I ordered the cavatelli pasta which was quite good too. We had a couple next to us and I saw them order the red dandelion salad which looked like a piece of art. All of their food looked like that. Overall, I left full but not stuffed. It was a very nice light lunch. Would I return? Maybe for drinks but the price of the food along with my not being a huge seafood fan, probably not. But who knows?

"Kassity L.","4/29/2017","Washington, DC","Very pricey place for pretty mediocre seafood. I didn't like that the food was generally salty, and portions of it weren't cooked very well. We ordered the uni appetizer, which we really liked (this was the best dish of the night). It came with some creamy pate or sauce, and complimented the uni very well. We also got the seafood sampling platter, which had a good assortment of different shellfish, lobster, crab, and uni. For our entrees, we ordered the turbot (a white fish), the langoustine, and the lobster ravioli. The turbot and the langoustine were slightly dry and overcooked. And all three dishes were over salted, especially the lobster ravioli, which was most disappointing of the three. The lobster ravioli by itself was ok but nothing too special. We were advertised it by our waiter, who described the ravioli sauce as being like a lobster bisque. The sauce tough was way to salty, so we had to avoid it altogether. The turbot also came with green peas, which were barely cooked and were still really hard and difficult to eat. Service was ok, but our waiter throughout the night slowly got more and more annoyed and curt with us because we took too much time with certain things, such as ordering dessert and paying.",3,4,0,0

My boyfriend ordered a $20 Bloody Mary and it seemed like it was sitting out for a while. It was warm and almost watered down. He also got 1 mimosa (the one that comes with the $45 brunch deal) and it immediately gave him a splitting headache. This tells me that they used bottom of the barrel alcohol. I ordered the Uova which was poached egg and jumbo crab cake. There was barely any crab???Honestly, I really wanted this to be a nice seafood brunch for my boyfriends birthday and it was just upsetting.

"Lauren S.","5/25/2017","College Park, MD","My boyfriend took me here for my graduation dinner and I was extremely excited!  We read good reviews and anticipated a delicious meal.  What we received was far from delicious for the over $160 bill.We ordered the Ancona appetizer, which looked amazing.  My mouth was watering as it sat on the table.  The prawns were okay, but not great.  The crab legs were average and tasted like the ones I usually get from the grocery store.  The lobster was mediocre.  As a clam lover, the clams were extremely disappointing and were not flavorful or meaty.  The mussels were average at best.  The rest was generally mediocre and a bit salty.  We sat in shock knowing that we paid over $80 for what we just ate.  As recently graduated college students we don't eat extremely expensive meals often as we are usually on tight budgets, but when we have they have been melt in your seat good.  This was very much the opposite.  Would not have even paid $40 for what was served.On top of this experience, the table behind us was complaining about their meals as well, stating how disappointed they were.  I don't know if there was a change in chef, but it definitely was not just us who was noticing that the food was not up to standard.Luckily, we ordered the grilled wild calamari, which was fairly good and reasonably priced, but after the previously consumed seafood, we could not get over how bad it was enough to thoroughly enjoy it.  On a positive note, the service was great and the wait staff was friendly.I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unfortunately.  I honestly am not a picky eater and will never make a fuss about a meal, but for the prices at the restaurant and the quality of food, I felt like I was doing a disservice to other potential customers by not speaking up.

"Naomi H.","5/29/2017","Sandy Springs, GA","This place was delicious! We chose this as one of our date nights in DC and it was the best meal we had when in town.The menu isn't very extensive, but that's okay. You can tell they put a lot of thought into their food. To drink we had the Frozen Painkiller and the Spring Garden. Both were 10/10 - amazingly balanced and again, the level of flavor in both was out of this world. I don't mind spending a little extra on dinner if the quality is there and the food and drinks did not disappoint!For an appetizer we split the grilled calamari. Hands down the best I've ever had. I wish more people (and resturants) would serve this grilled vs fried. It is so delicate when prepared correctly and this alone was the best dish we had in DC.As for entrees, we split the Lobster Ravioli and whole fish. The lobster was a little salty and the portion was a too small for the price. The whole fish was outstanding, especially when complimented by their salsa verde. On to dessert - we ordered the Tiramisu (c'mon, the boyfriend is Italian) and not only did we get the Tiramisu, but we also were served their house donuts with delectable dark chocolate sauce and the chocolate cake with mint and pistachios. Why we were served three desserts, I have absolutely no idea, but we ate every bite! I was so full by the end of the meal I didn't think we'd ever eat again. So worth it looking back, but such a bad decision at the time.Our waitress was Christina and she made the dinner that much better.

I have never eaten calamari that was grilled before and I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was! I definitely recommend getting the calamari here. One thing I didn't like was how they basically told us that all the outside seating was reserved even though barely any people were sitting outside and none of the tables had a reserved sign on them.  We ended up sitting outside at a high top table near the entrance which was kind of shitty but oh well.

We easily spent 45 minutes- to one hour longer because of slow services between courses. Maybe because we sat by the window? It was also too hot to sit there. But had to repeatedly ask for water, our wine, for them to clear plates, to bring the next course, check. I don't like having to look for the server throughout the meal. It's distracting especially when our family had other plans we had to cancel. I wish Fiola Mare would invest the time and training to have the service as strong as the quality of their ingredients. This is why again and again, I find Le Diplomate to be a solid choice. Their service is excellent and it changes the experience.Our server at Fiola was rushed, not pleasant, didn't make the meal feel special, and there were moments when she forgot about us. Our reservation was for 2pm. By then, the brunch rush died down. She was in a hurry to leave since we then were given another server.

From our very first visit we knew we would come back. We've been here many times since then, for brunch, regular dinners, dinners with out of town guests, Pre-Theater, and celebratory dinners and every single time we've had a wonderful experience with impeccable service and delicious food.  This is the kind of restaurant where you can bring your friends who appreciate a good meal but also your parents will be impressed.  Sure, you need to dress up a little more than you would on 14th but you're grown! You can't wear athleisure or caps everywhere right? I have also recommended Fiola Mare to friends who need to schedule business dinners and I've received several thankful emails after.  We've tried a lot of their menu and have never been disappointed. Our food favorites include the bread basket, ricotta pancakes, and prawn grits for brunch.  For dinner we're big fans of the calamari by the pound, and pretty much every pasta dish we've tried. While their bomboloni is very popular, I prefer their panna cotta.  The only dish I haven't order more than once is the burrata because I'm a burrata snob and this one is a little firmer and chewy for my taste.

"K V.","6/28/2017","Washington, DC","You must be joking. Honestly, what a scorcher, but of the wrong kind.  The only sense that I can make of the population of DC raving about this place is .. The Emperor's New Clothes.First up, I took the recommendation of my server, the swordfish balls. I fizzled out with sheer boredom after the second ball - these had as much taste (none) as the plasticized 'fish- fingers' that were all the rave in the 1970s in England (the heyday of over-processed 'modern' food). McDonalds fare actually has more taste. And the tomato slop sauce that accompanied the fish-balls was stunning - I can't cook, yet even my tomato sauce (with garlic, sea salt, freshly-prepped tomatoes, etc) has vastly more flavor and texture than this.Then (this was Sunday brunch) came the pastry basket. Safeway's ready-boxed pastries excel by comparison.  Worse, I was not given fresh implements, so my tomato sauce/ swordfish smeared knife had to be used for my jam/ croissant and pain-au-chocolat. How very McDonalds of them.Then came a burrata. But still no fresh implements. Yes, that's the same set of implements for 3 courses!!! So my now swordfish-tomato-jam-chocolate-butter-smeared knife was all I had with which to assail my burrata. This is how they present their burrata? Burrata? In essence, you are telling me that your burrata is inedible, if this is what you expect me to interact with.The wahoo was acceptable, nothing at all special. But then I guess I've been spoiled with the restaurants in fishing villages in Ireland, Ecuador, Portugal, etc, etc.I was so profoundly bored by my food experience here that - just 3 days on - I can't even remember what my mint-chocolate dessert tasted like. The GM noticed something was amiss, so waived my bill. At least that was gracious of him, which is only fair to highlight. But what is clear is that they have just got too cocky and stopped trying to excel at anything a very long time ago. Do yourself a favor and go to Fiola by Archives instead - they may be sibling restaurants, but truly they are 'chalk-and-cheese' (no pun intended!) in terms of standards. Whoosh!",1,0,0,0
"Lee C.","7/1/2017","Great Neck, NY","This is absolutely the most delicious and elegant restaurant I've been to in DC. We went for a special occasion, a birthday, and received very special attention by everyone from the girl who sat us to the waiter, sommelier, maitre d' and even the busboys, with extra dishes, desserts and even a birthday card from the owners!Every dish ordered by our table of 4 was prepared meticulously and perfectly: burrata, tuna antipasti, Dover sole, branzino, halibut and amazing side dishes such as the sautéed mushrooms, spinach, potatoes. The sommelier helped us with wine choices that truly complemented everything in our meal. The desserts were amazing - the chocolate cake, the doughnuts and a delicious dessert wine. A very hot night so we chose to sit inside at an elegant table in a lovely, quiet room where we received unflagging attention throughout this incredible meal. Very expensive but worth every penny!",5,0,0,0
"Paul M.","7/3/2017","Tampa, FL","We were traveling to D.C. for our 2 year wedding anniversary and were looking for a great place to have dinner. This place came highly recommended. I made the reservation 2 weeks in advance. We arrived 25 minutes early and they were already ready to seat us! Incredible! They called us by name and wished us a happy anniversary. We were then greeted by our server, Maly. Words cannot describe the level of truly incredible service he and his team provided. We both ordered the Adriatic mixed grilled seafood. It was superb!! Maly made some great recommendations for sides which paired perfectly with our meal. Throughout the evening, he came by to ensure everything was to our liking. He came by and brought us our own menu to take home signed by himself and the chef!! Maly and his team went above and beyond to make our meal perfect in every way. I cannot think of one thing I would've changed. I've dined at some the finest restaurants in the country. The service and food here is hard to beat. This was truly the highlight of our trip. If you're in the area and looking for a true fine dining experience, look no further.",5,0,0,0
"Gladstone P.","7/5/2017","Washington, DC","The space is beautiful and the service beyond reproach. The food was excellent though somewhat overpriced but you expect that when you make the reservation. You are paying for the experience and not necessarily groundbreaking cuisine, but quality produce and respectful takes on seafood classics in a special atmosphere. First, we started at the bar and had expertly prepared cocktails: The Frozen Painkiller or something was a refreshing take on a pina colada and our friend's Ginger Pimm was stellar. Bar staff treat you with so much respect, not like you're bothering them for getting a drink. That theme runs throughout the restaurant. The Ancona seafood tower was scrumptious. The Tiger Prawns and King Crab really shined and the oysters, again while pricey, were spectacularly fresh. No one at the table was an urchin fan, so they substituted some extra shaved scallop crudo. Excellent clams to boot. So fresh. So delicious. It felt plucked right out of the sea table side. Our entrees were all stunners. Especially my friend's Branzino. It is so easy to screw fish up. At these prices, you'd hope they wouldn't and they didn't. Classic treatments of scallop, mixed grill and Brodetto were all on point. The sides were somewhat disappointing (potatoes and spinach) but only because the portion size and lack of ingenuity per the simple and elegant preparations of the seafood felt a bit mailed-in. Then again, they're called ""sides"" for a reason. The wine list was extensive and we actually paired a nice, crisp Verdicchio which as perfecto with our meal. Our sommelier was a bit aggressive (for me who thinks he knows a little something about wine), but he was right on choices and beyond courteous. Overpriced, like all booze, but when your mindset is ""special anything-goes"" it wasn't atrocious. Dessert was good, not great. But I don't go out for desserts and not the biggest sweet tooth. 3 *s for the food; 5 for the ambiance.",4,3,0,1

"Alan G.","7/23/2017","Buffalo, NY","Came here for dinner with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary and could not be more happy with our experience at this restaurant. Upon arrival we were welcomed by the friendly staff and brought over to our table within just a few minutes as we waited for it to be set. Could not have asked for a more perfect ambiance: mood lighting, candle, low noise level. When I had called to make the reservation, I was asked if I was celebrating any special event. I told the hostess that I was celebrating my anniversary, and so, when we were given our menus, we saw that they had given us special ""anniversary"" menus, which made our experience that much more welcoming and made us as guests feel important. Our waiter, Anton, was very knowledgeable and went over the entire menu with us. He was even nice enough to bring us some complimentary champagne for our special night. For appetizer, we ordered the burrata, which came on a bed of porcini mushrooms. Then, for our main course, we got the branzino with a side of  the sautéed wild mushrooms. When the fish came to the table, it was filleted right in front of us, which was really cool to watch. The branzino also came with some salsa verde, which was a perfect topping for the fish. I'd say that it was probably the best branzino I've ever had. After our meal, we were too full for dessert, but our waiter would not let us leave without having something sweet, so they brought us a small vanilla cake. Before leaving, we spoke a bit with our waiter, getting to know him a bit on a personal level, which made our experience that much more enjoyable. We were also given a card, congratulating us on our anniversary and thanking us for coming to the restaurant. Overall, we absolutely loved our dinner here and would 100% recommend for anyone else to go if you're looking for a very nice night out.",5,0,0,0
"Martin Z.","7/24/2017","Bethesda, MD","May be the best restaurant in the city. Came in with a college buddy, both of us casually dressed and still got great service. I call this the bumpkin test. Burrata was creamy and rich with some crisp things, a base that was like caponata and a sauce of some kind. Tagliatelle with shrimp and Maryland crab had a subtle tomato sauce that let the fresh seafood star, the pasta was fresh and al dente. Sorbets were fresh and clean tasting with a light hand on the sugar. The apricot was especially good.

I'm not sure if it was because they were busy or it's because our waiter didn't put our orders in, or a combination of the two. Regardless, food was cold and mediocre.After we had left the building and paid, the manager came running after us to apologize and asked to comp half our meal.

A great wine story for sure and a perfect example of how to lose four customers for life. After pressing them on the matter, they offered a $200 gift card (which they never sent) for a future dining experience - what a pathetic customer service response. The measure of a good restaurant isn't perfection, but character - they are sorely lacking in the latter.",1,2,1,0
"Eric L.","8/6/2017","Chevy Chase, MD","This is probably the best place to go to for seafood and pasta. The handmade noodles are something special and the quality of the seafood is top notch.

"Janine M.","8/7/2017","Washington, DC","Our meal at Fiola Mare was nothing short of excellent. We came by for dinner for my husband's birthday and were extremely impressed from end to end.We warmed up with a couple drinks: one Smoked and one Old Fashioned, the latter of which completely lived up to the hype that I had seen on Yelp proclaiming that Fiola Mare's is ""the best Old Fashioned I've ever had.""  We split the burrata with porcini mushrooms, which was decadent, flavorful, and portioned just right to keep us from filling up before our main course. While we were were indulging ourselves on cheese, a waiter came by with small samples of tomato watermelon gazpacho, which was totally unique and surprisingly tasty.Great as the drinks and appetizers were, our entrees were the stars of our meal. I had the Acquerello Risotto, which is full of truffle butter and cheese; if you like either of those things, you'll love this. My husband had the scallops and loved them, and while I'm normally not a fan, these were an exception on account of their unbelievable sauce (tomato based?). Again, the portions were perfect--both of us were quite full at the end, but were able to polish off almost everything on our plates without too much of an issue.Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your philosophy, this kept the proverbial door open for dessert. Per the recommendation of our waiter, Robbynn (more on him shortly), we got the Coppetta, which included three scoops of gelato: vanilla, hazelnut, and pistachio. All three were dangerously good but we both agreed that the hazelnut was the best we've ever had. Robbynn was everything you want in a waiter: attentive (but not overbearing), friendly (but not too much so), knowledgeable (but not pushy), and extremely generous. Upon finding out that we were celebrating a birthday, he brought us two small flutes of sparkling dessert wine and a small sampling of another dessert (some sort of light pie), all of which was complimentary (as was the gazpacho). We were completely impressed by the quality of service of everyone we encountered, which, when considered along with the tremendous quality of our food, makes Fiola Mare an obvious choice for a nice evening out and a five star review.",5,2,1,0

Everything was exquisitely cooked and served.  The only downside of Fiola Mare, for my age group, is that it's expensive and filled with crowd in their 40s that looks rich, reserved  and serious.  Nevertheless, if you have a good occasion to celebrate and would like to try Italian seafood and pasta dishes it might be a place to consider.

"Donna C.","8/21/2017","Arlington, VA","This place has amazing ambiance and super helpful wait staff. We LOVED their drinks and it's an extremely pleasant place to spend an afternoon/early evening. Maybe our expectations were raised by all the rave reviews but we left thinking: the kitchen can hit it out of the ballpark (bucatini with prawns) but it also leaves one yawning, and a little bit hungry. At prices like this - and pasta portions so small - every dish should stand out. They do not. I'll start with a harbinger of ""meh"" things to come: the olive oil brought to the table with the excellent crusty bread. Bitter. Tasted like the kind we buy from Costco for cooking, not to showcase in some delicate salads or enjoy on its own with some salt and hot pepper flakes. Two in our party had the vaunted lobster ravioli - the lobster meat was tough and chewy and didn't have that fresh lobster taste. We'd like to go back and try more of the grilled fish. You cannot just order pasta here - it is definitely just a first course - so the bill easily runs to $100 per person, or more. One other low mark for the panna cotta, which was a tiny sliver of rubbery custard buried under what looked like wild blueberry compote, which had a slightly acrid aftertaste. Olive oil and panna cotta - two staples of Italian cooking - were below par at Fiola Mare - that was a surprise and a disappointment. Fiola Mare can easily be described as overpriced, but if you choose your dishes well and get a great table it is worth the extra dollars now and then.",3,0,0,0

We ordered the Frutti di are (so good!), the lobster ravioli, another entree, and two desserts. Our waitress was very nice, passionate about the restaurant, and gave us a very tasty anniversary cake. I left thinking this is such a nice place and I will come back for all our anniversaries. However, I recently booked a reservation for Restaurant Week and arrived 20min earlier. We brought our dog and I called ahead to request outdoor seating. However, when we arrived at the restaurant, the usher said she needed to check if we can sit down with a dog. Then she confirmed that we could sit outside but the dog needed to be on the other side. We agreed and was led by another waitress to the seat. When we arrived at the outdoor seating area, the waitress there did not seem certain about what to do. She did not greet us at all, glanced at us, and asked us to wait. The waitress who led the way also stopped us from entering the seating area. Then we were led to the seat. As we prepared to sit down, another person came out, asking if we had a license. At that moment, I've lost all my appetite and my good impression of this place. I came hoping for a good dining experience, not only once, but many in future. However, based on my yesterday's experience, I did not feel welcomed, and even feel humiliated. If this place does not welcome pets, I should be informed when I made the call. I feel this was a waste of energy and emotions. It might be that they are understaffed yesterday due to the Restaurant Week and summer schedules, but it was not handled professionally in a customer friendly manner.

Additionally, the waiters were very attentive and informative about all the items on the menu. they were every helpful in filling me in on parts of the menu. Granted, I won't be a regular at this restaurant purely because of how expensive it is, but I would definitely come here for a special occasion. I ordered the Bucatini and my girlfriend ordered the Wild Alaskan Halibut Fillet while Fiola Mare started us off with bread and a delicious olive oil with a slight kick to it. For the Alaskan Halibut, the halibut itself wasn't anything special, but the truffle vinaigrette on it made the dish SHINE. The truffle flavor blended perfectly with the halibut, and the halibut texture was as soft as a cloud. It practically melted when you put it in your mouth. On the other hand, the bucatini was incredibly delicious all around! The bucatini consisted of red king prawns, japanese sea urchin, and homemade pasta. It is by far one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The prawns were extremely fresh and sweet (by far the BEST shrimps I've ever had in my life). I felt almost heartbroken when I finished them. This dish was definitely a 10/10 on my books. I would highly recommend everyone to try the bucatini!Fiola Mare is definitely an incredible restaurant with a great environment and an even more amazing food.

"Sarah V.","9/11/2017","Bethesda, MD","We went here last night for anniversary dinner and they pulled out all of the stops. I was impressed with the hostess who said Happy Anniversary upon arrival and... wait for it... departure too! We had awesome seats right in front of the kitchen. Our server was amazing - from wine recommendations to taking our photo several times until she thought it was perfect (it's so rare these days). She brought us champagne and dessert at the end of the night and a card from Fabio. I'm still dreaming about the eggplant purée on my halibut. The Mark Hayzee dessert was absolutely amazing! We loved celebrating our anniversary here and would recommend Fiola Mare to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion.",5,1,0,1

"Effy L.","9/14/2017","Boyds, MD","Another Michelin 1 star Italian restaurant. Great experience! I ordered Singoku Oyster, which come with cucumber mignonette and Calvinism caviar; Alaskan king crab salad, which tasted a little sweet, little salty, little spicy, and fresh crab, so interesting. For my entrees, I've ordered beef cheek tortellini and Nova Scotia lobster ravioli. The ravioli is full of crab meat. For dessert, I took The gianduia piemontese and summer peaches(strongly recommended by waiter) yes I love the summer peaches, it was not sweet, it tasted a little sour, peachy, I have no words to describe it. It tasted like summer. Love it! The waiter was very professional, he knows everything about their menu. If I have to say something bad: don't seat outside in autumn!

"Sonya C.","9/18/2017","Washington, DC","The ambiance is beautiful and for the most part, the food is delightful but there's something about the service on my particular visit that was a little off. We started with raw oysters that were delicious, fresh and flavorful. Before I ordered my next course, I remembered to tell the server about my allergies : no cucumbers or bell peppers; simple and easily understood. My salmon arrived with something that resembled  pickled cucumber as an accompaniment.  I questioned the server and was assured it was safe for me to eat. In less than three minutes he hurriedly returned to our table and told me not to touch the accompaniment because it may contain ""some"" cucumber.  It turned out to be ALL cumcumber. He originally said it was zucchini. The server never really apologized, just hurried away hoping I wouldn't drop dead from being poisoned. The manager arrived and apologized suggesting that it may have been a language issue. STOP, no excuse. Even the manager had to admit that the server should have summoned him if he didn't thoroughly understand what was being communicated. Allergies are serious business. We loved our salmon and branzino. Both were cooked perfectly.  Dessert was a deliciously rich ""decomposed"" tarimosu.  I just wish the server had been more honest about his mistake. The total meal was comped and we left a nice tip. We'd go back so I guess we'll call it a truse.",3,0,0,0

"Kevin G.","9/21/2017","Washington, DC","This place is as classy as classy gets in DC. I was definitely underdressed but was never made to feel out of place by the staff (unlike in Fiola, which I may have given 5 stars a little preemptively...). The staff and service here was fantastic. Also I usually don't like sitting outside but the patio with the view of the skyline is way too pretty to pass up! On to the food, they gave us a complimentary amuse bouche, which was a blue fin tuna crudo. For the entrees, we had the Bucatini, Lobster Ravioli, and the Brodetto. The lobster ravioli was amazing. It comes with a lobster tail, two meaty claws, and three raviolis stuffed with lobster. The sauce was creamy and lobster-y. I was practically drinking it out of the bowl! The prawns that came with the bucatini were like butter. I didn't quite get the Japanese Sea Urchin taste but the sauce was pretty fishy. The brodetto was an assortment of fish, cooked to perfection. I was expecting more of a soupy broth, but they end up pouring a thicker sauce tableside. For dessert, we had the bomboloni, which was great. The torrone gelato was so different and the doughnuts went perfectly with the dark chocolate sauce. On top of drinking the lobster ravioli sauce, I also went to town on that chocolate sauce.Overall, everything was cooked perfectly and this may be one of the best seafood experiences I've had in DC. The reason for the four stars, instead of the five, is 1) I'm not sure the flavor profiles for the bucatini and brodetto were completely up my alley. I mean they were delicious and it was some of the best cooked fish I've had in the area but I'm not sure I would crave those dishes again. 2) The prices are pretty steep for what you get. The atmosphere, service, and food are great so the prices are understandable, but you definitely have to order more than one entree to get full.If you want to rub elbows with the rich and politically famous or just want really great seafood, then look no further. Fiola Mare definitely impresses!",4,4,1,3

"T B.","9/30/2017","Austin, TX","Visiting the harbor this morning and wanted to have cocktails (mimosas) however the restaurant would not allow us to sit at an outside table and directed us to the bar area around the corner. When we went to the area, it was inside, very dark and warm. We asked the hostess if we could sit at their outside area for morning beverages and they said that they only allow people who were eating brunch to dine outside and we were welcome to drink at the bar. This seems like a strange rule, especially since their restaurant was nearly empty. If it was a revenue thing, the average drink was $15 glass, which we easily would have have a couple each, amounting to a $100 bill. And who knows, maybe we would have had something small to eat. Seriously bad customer service. Businesses like this give the NE it's pretentious reputation.",1,4,2,0
"Alan S.","10/4/2017","Rockville, MD","There are plenty of restaraunts with great food. There are also plenty where the service is great. The rare few can do both, Fiola Mare is one of them. My wife and I went there for our anniversary and the staff was EXEMPLARY. It started at the bar with Jeff. I was looking at rums and he made a number of suggestions. He was friendly and knew his spirits. Everything you want in a bartender!I believe our waitress was Christin. She was friendly, smiled and thanked us for spending our anniversary with them. She was attentive without hovering. The wild halibut was cooked perfectly as was the lobster ravioli. The flavors were fantastic!  It wasn't just Christin though, every member of the wait staff was friendly courteous and attentive. It seemed like each took a moment to thank us for spending the evening with them. When we ordered dessert Christin brought us something different than what we had ordered and told us that it would be a better choice based on some food preferences we had expressed earlier. It was different and AMAZING (they also comp'd it which wasn't at all necessary but, itwas a nice touch). Paying attention to a customers preferences is so rare these days. If it seems I can't say enough good things about Fiola Mare the answer is simple, I can't! I could go on and on. Expensive yes,  but worth it!",5,0,0,0
"R.L. C.","10/8/2017","Washington, DC","Went for a birthday dinner last night. The entire experience was marked by consistently poor service and an air of pretense that was undeserved/unwelcome. As a fan of good food, I expect first-rate service at top of the market restaurants like Fiola Mare. Upon entering, the hostess walks us around back and seats us at a tight 2 person side table outside with no view. Not to be too ""extra"" on our end, we accept the table (it was a busy night), but before we could sit down she had to run back and triple check that that was in fact our table. Not a seamless process, but forgivable and not memorable had the rest of the evening gone well. We then wait for close to 10 minutes before we were asked what type of water we want. Fail. Our water comes out 5 minutes later and still no waitress. 10 minutes pass and we then solicit a waiter of a different table to at least take our drink order and to get the server. He was a great guy...apologizes and offers us two glasses of champagne on the house. At this point, we were willing to look beyond a few hiccups and enjoy our meal. It was, in fact, my bday. 5-10 more minutes pass and still no waiter/waitress. Fail. At this point, a manager comes buy to take our order. He was nice and tried to accommodate us, but at what was sure to be a $200 meal, it seems perfectly reasonable to actually get the consultation/service of an actual server. When I asked for ""recommendations"" the manager gave me a full break down of the menu. I smiled at the unsolicited definition of ""del mar"" I received, but I digress. Pro-tip: don't assume those sort of definitions are needed...they can send the wrong signal about your perception of your patrons. In any event, here's the kicker...the waitress finally comes over and you would think we were doing her a favor or interrupting her day! She was super smug and was literally sulking and annoyed that she had to deal with us at all. She fired off a few unprofessional lines about us ""needing to order or something."" At that point, we couldn't take it, we left. I was shocked that she dealt with us on those terms and even more shocked that she did this in front of a manager. The manager then tried to offer us another table inside with a different server, but at that point, it really wasn't worth spending any more time and energy on an establishment that doesn't value our business. We left. The manager did comp our apps and two drinks. A nice gesture.  It's a shame too. We've eaten there before when it first opened and had a first-rate experience. Never again. We left Fiola Mare and headed to Sequoia. There, we had a fun experience and dealt with much better service and energy from the staff. Per the recommendation of our  Sequoia waiter, I ordered the Lobster and it was delicious (small aside in case anyone is interested) and I enjoyed the revamped decor. My parting question to Fiola Mare is this...Why drop $200 bucks at a restaurant that acts as though I'm doing THEM a FAVOR by expecting basic service?!?",1,6,5,5

Brilliant.  The portions were more than fair as with tasting menus tend to get a bit small and you leave hungry.  Not here.  My only minor issue are the liqueur prices.  Wine was steep for sure but I had one crown royal and it was a ""short maybe one once measured pour"" for 16 bucks!

I really shouldn't have ordered anything but I ordered their roasted potatoes. They ordered a seafood deal that cost like $100 so they could share with each other. Presentation is on point. Even as a vegan, I give credit where it's due. Looks can be deceiving and in this case, it is. Friends were highly disappointed with their food. Lack of flavors. Some tasted old.As for my roasted potatoes, looked more like mashed potatoes. I guess I didn't see the crushed part or maybe that's what Italians call mashed potatoes, they call it crushed smoked potatoes, as per menu. Listed on menu is olive oil and parsley. They forgot to mention drowned in butter. There was really no flavor and the parsley did not compliment the dish. I couldn't even take another bite.

The service was amazing and they had a birthday menu set for my boyfriend and said happy birthday to him when we came in for our reservation. We ordered the lobster ravioli, which was amazing, but the portion size was a little small for the price. You can ask for half portions if you don't want the full portion so you can try more things (the portion is very small though). We also ordered the Adriatic seafood dish, the branzino and the side of potatoes. The seafood was very good and fresh but we felt that the fish was a little too expensive for just an average taste and there wasn't anything mind blowing about the food. It was a fun experience and the atmosphere was very romantic but we felt the food could've had more of a wow factor especially for the price of the food.

"Kerry N.","11/12/2017","Annapolis, MD","We visited this lovely restaurant for my fiance's work party. They rented out the place, it was a great experience from start to finish. The restaurant has such romantic lighting and decor, it is very visually pleasing. Every glimpse at their wine storage was impressive, and the decor just felt so clean and really added to the atmosphere. The staff really aim to please... There were probably 50 staff members tending to us. Several greeters, bartenders, servers tending to you at all times... I thought they did so wonderfully. The drinks were delicious, their bar is fully stocked with some eclectic liquors. The mules were delicious, red wine was a blend and it was excellent. The passed hors d'oeuvres were tasty... Seafood buffet, Tortellini, crab cakes, scallop, truffle pastries, etc. The dinner was a multi course experience. The chef and staff clearly care tremendously about each guest having the full experience. Dishes are dropped at each guest's place all at once in unison as the head server describes what was prepared. The size of each course is not huge, but by the end of the dinner I was perfectly satisfied. The first course was a burrata cheese dish. Flavorful, creamy, delicious. The second course was a lobster ravioli with lobster tail. I typically do not eat lobster, the texture was not my favorite. A little chewy. But the flavor of the tomato cream sauce and the ravioli itself was just outstanding... Everyone spoke highly of it. The 3rd course was a poached cod dish with microgreens and a balsamic reduction. The fish fell apart perfectly with a fork, and it was very moist and yummy. The 4th dish was filet mignon with an espresso whipped potato. The bitterness of the coffee flavor was very apparent throughout. The filet was medium rare, perfectly tender. I dislike coffee but still enjoyed this dish. The last course was dessert, my personal favorite since I am a chocolaholic. The dish was a rich chocolate fudge type square with some green herb sauce (basil?), mint mousse, and a crunchy pistachio crumble. It was so beautiful but so delicious. The pistachio paired with the dark chocolate flavor made it for me. I actually ended up having the rest of someone else's dessert (she was full). Wow. That was amazing.  Highly recommend trying this unique experience... For a high end meal, it was an experience that I really enjoyed!!",5,0,0,0
"Vincent C.","11/19/2017","Boston, MA","Fiola Mare is an excellent restaurant with stellar food and upstanding service. Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted and seated. My waitress soon came by and offered a thorough explanation of the menu. She then proceeded to recommend the Fiola Mare Lobster Ravioli, which is what I ordered.After a brief 10 minute wait, my food had arrived. To be honest, I was skeptical at first, as I'm normally not a fan of ginger. However, they made it work. The ginger and chive sauce perfectly seasoned the lobster and ravioli and tied together the entire dish. In fact, the sauce was so good I even asked for additional bread to soak up the sauce. On top of that, each beautifully crafted ravioli was chalk full of lobster, with hardly any filler present. My only slight complaint about Fiola Mare is the service; it's too good. It's great that everything was fast and attentive, but I did feel a bit annoyed. The staff kept incessantly commenting on the food and asking me how the food was. In fact, I was even asked how it was before I had a chance to taste anything!",5,0,0,0

"Vin P.","11/29/2017","Washington, DC","Overall experience:I definitely rate Fiola Mare a 5/5 for an overall experience. The service was great, the atmosphere of the place was nice, the view was fantastic, and the food was amazing. I dined for two in the evening, and the staff without a doubt took care of us. We were celebrating an anniversary and I thought it was very nice of them to give a congratulatory card with our dinner. Below you'll read about my experience. Thank you Fiola Mare; I will surely be coming back again.Getting Seated:Upon being seated a gentleman introduced himself, Maly Dy, and presented us with complimentary champagne since we were celebrating an anniversary. Maly would also be assisting us throughout the rest of the evening and was very professional.After handing us the menus Maly informed us about all the specials and favorites from the dinner menu. Another gentleman approached us and introduced himself as the sommelier for the evening to ask if we needed any assistance with choosing wine. Though I opted to not, since I already had my eye on something, it is always helpful having a sommelier in house when it comes to pairings.Appetizer:Ancona (raw/steamed cold seafoods)-Oysters, clams, mussels, lobster, tiger prawns, sea urchin, sea scallops, king crab, langoustines, and salmon tartareThoughts: This was presented with three different sauces and all three paired really well with each seafood. I've had plenty of cold seafood before and the Ancona was exquisite! The presentation, the colors, and the flavors were amazing, and everything tasted very sweet and fresh. Main Course:Lobster RavioliThoughts: The lobster ravioli came with thee large pieces of ravioli with lobster claw on the side. Each bite was bursting with flavors and was not overpowering at all; it was perfectly balanced. The lobster was extremely sweet, and when paired with the sauce it was even better. This is definitely a must order.Norwegian HalibutThoughts: The halibut was very soft and tender. Halibut indeed is difficult to cook, however this was cooked perfectly and not overdone at all. Having each bite needs to be with the bergamot jam. This was very delicious and glad I ordered it.Sides:Wilted SpinachThoughts: Upon ordering this I imagined we would get old looking spinach, which I was wrong. The spinach looked fresh and was seasoned with a hint of lemon. This was an excellent pair with the seafood we ordered.Salt Roasted PotatoesThoughts: Between the two sides we ordered this was my favorite. It was with olive oil and sea salt and it made each bite of the potatoes melt in your mouth.Dessert:TiramisuThoughts: The Tiramisu was infused with 5 year aged Madeira zambaglione. Some of the bet Tiramisu I've ever had. It was light and fluffy. Some of the best Tiramisu I've ever had!Lemon cakeThoughts: This was given to us on the house for our celebration. I normally don't like eating cakes but this was definitely something that had to be eaten. Like the Tiramisu, it was very light and fluffy after each bite. A nice way to end the night.",5,0,0,0

The girl who greeted us, Kenya, was so disrespectful, not with words but with actions, and I think it was intentional. She asked me if I have a reservation, I said no, and she immediately said I am sorry but you can either sit at the bar or we can't seat you, the wait is 1:30min. The way she said it is what bothered me, it did not seem genuine, it seemed she just didn't want to seat us. I said fine I'll wait, I gave her my number and within seconds I got a text confirmation. Within minutes I checked Yelp for reservation and wala, I got a reservation less than 30 min and the rest is history. I don't think this was Kenya's fault, I think this's coming from management.I'll not return here.",1,1,0,0
"Stephanie B.","12/16/2017","VT, VT","Well I have only eaten here once before, around last Christmas --found it to be spectacular.  We didn't have trouble getting a last minute reservation (well, we ate very late).  Our server whose name I unfortunately can't recall did a superb job with his recommendations.  And that's why we loved so many of our dishes.  We had 3 appetizers and two main dishes.  The highlights of the meal for me were the cocktail which was smoked using some wood and then infused into the drink was just so well done, and I don't use this word often it was exquisite.  The lobster ravioli, one of their signatures was also amazing.  It's all lobster.  But what sets it apart is the intensely flavored sauce.  I also liked the artistic 'Under the Sea' appetizer.  Highly recommend.  Besides that, it was an overall immensely satisfying meal.  The other cocktails I had after the smoky one did disappoint but overall, I would not hesitate to go back.  Loooved it!",5,0,0,0
"Jon V.","12/18/2017","Tokyo, Japan","Firstly, this is an upscale Italian restaurant and it ticks all the boxes - riverside dining with a view of the sunset. Fresh seafood, extensive wine list, and daily changing menu. The quality of the food is without a doubt above average but not highly above so, the pasta was slightly oversalted for my tastes and also portions quite small. My gripes are mostly with the price. For a 3 course dinner with wine, be prepared to pay upwards of $180 or more. The same meal in New York or San Francisco would probably be somewhere north of $100. For the price, I honestly cannot recommend this place unless you are here to impress in Washington DC. Otherwise, I would typically avoid this place simply due to the price.",2,1,0,0
"Judy N.","12/24/2017","Oak Hill, VA","Words cannot describe the marvelous food and superb service we had at Fiola Mare. We were greeted the second we walked in and our coats were taken immediately. We were escorted to our table and the service throughout was attentive, personal and upscale. My husband and I celebrated Christmas Eve with the Fiola Mare Signature Brunch. We enjoyed every satisfying sip and bite of the warm cinnamon roll and our drink and dish selections. I ordered the spiced melograno, which was one of their mocktails that weren't on the menu. It had everything festive - pomegranate juice, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and club soda. It's more on the sweet side and to my liking. My husband loved the fresh raw oysters and the  steamed mussels with the sweet San Marzano tomatoes as our appetizers. I didn't think the mussels were outrageous or anything special but it was still good. The dish that captured my heart was the lobster ravioli. It's not titled ravioli lobster. It's LOBSTER ravioli where huge chunks of lobster were the majority of the dish. There were only two raviolis which were filled with more lobster meat. But the star of the dish was definitely the succulent and melt in my mouth lobster meat on a bed of creamy, not too salty sauce. I also loved the squid ink bucatini which our server said will be available for a limited time. I cannot resist squid ink pasta cooked perfectly al dente with a buttery shallot sauce. Just when I thought the entrees were the highlight of our brunch, we had the most amazing desserts. The marchesi was my favorite where the decadent chocolate imported from Italy with the crunchy and salty pistachios were a great combination. I also enjoyed the bomboloni with ricotta donuts holes dipped in warm salted caramel sauce with vanilla gelato. My heart was full when our desserts arrived with a surprise lemon mousse cake and celebratory card from the owners, Mario & Fabio Trabocchi! What a wonderful way to end our brunch! I was already so impressed with the details of this place but the congratulations surprise made it more touching and personal.",5,4,3,5

"Courtney N.","12/28/2017","Ashburn, VA","Finally tried this beautiful waterfront restaurant a couple of months ago. First impressions: amazing views, elegant decor, very upscale. Food: Fresh French food that's worth every penny. I got the crab pasta, which was served with fresh al dente noodles. The crab was plentiful and the tomato sauce wasn't overbearing. My mom got the arugula salad and added prawns to it. She enjoyed her delicious salad very much, especially the giant prawns. We also got an order of oysters and the burrata appetizer. Both delicious and recommended. My little cousin wanted fries, but unfortunately they weren't able to accommodate, not did they have a kids menu. She ended up getting butter pasta, which was good but not satisfactory to her. So we got her the donut dessert to fill her up, which she enjoyed a lot. It was a little too sweet and fried for me but the others at our table liked it. I'd recommend for a date night or brunch. They have a good wine selection and our waiter was very attentive.",5,1,0,1

"Amaya S.","12/30/2017","Los Angeles, CA","In preparation for my trip to Washington DC I did extensive analysis of which delicacies to indulge in while visiting the Nation's Capitol.  And by extensive analysis I mean Google.  In process, of analyzing, I stumbled upon a ""Meals to try while in DC"" list.  Low and behold the number #1 dish was the Lobster Ravioli of Fiola Mare.  So, in an effort to live my best life....I came. I saw. I ate.:::::LOCATION:::::Fiola Mare is located along the picturesque Potomac River in Georgetown.  There is a nice park area, more eateries, and a few river boat cruise options within walking distance.  You can reach the major part of Georgetown by walking up a small hill (unless its the dead of Summer like when I went, it felt like Mt. Kilimanjaro).  :::::DECOR:::::Fiola Mare sticks to what youd imagine a seaside seafood restaurant would look like - plenty of windows, rich wood, and crisp but subdued colors.  There is seating in the bar area, main dining room, and the highly coveted outdoor patios that overlook the river.  I chose the patio.Also, they arent decor...but the staff were amazing to look at.  I think everyone had an accent. Well at least my waiter did. Once he spoke no one else existed, I digress.:::::FOOD:::::I came for a causal lunch.  Well, as casual as a $100 lunch could be.  Be warned this place is pricey.  They do have cheaper lunch options, like a three course lunch.  But I went for the gold. The Lobster Ravioli.I started my meal off with a glass or two of Prosecco and a 1/2 dozen of Oysters.  I quickly followed that up with a glass or three of Rose.Lobster Ravioli ($54) - you can ask for the lunch size portion which is the perfect size and cheaper also.  Look, let me tell you now....this was the best dish I have ever tasted.  Honestly.  It was AMAZING. I had 3 sumptuous seafood filled raviolis, topped with HEALTHY portions of Lobster meat, all swimming in the worlds most delicious sauce.  So good, I ate all the table bread trying to sop it up.  Jesus himself came down from heaven to make this dish.Run here now and order this.Service was amazing which made the total experience that much better.  Worth EVERY penny. Thank gawd my card wasnt declined, come on credit.",5,6,8,7
"Julie H.","1/1/2018","Rockville, MD","Dreams do come true! It's been a long ""bucket list"" item to dine at Fiola Mare in Georgetown DC. The luxe and modern restaurant is home to sophisticated Italian seafood, wine & cocktails. The restaurant is right on the Georgetown waterfront. The restaurant is quite pricey, but definitely a good choice to enjoy a fancy dinner.Tutto Crudo is raw seafood, simply prepared. The Wild Japanese Hamachi topped with Venetian spices, persimmon mostarda and kale. Beautifully prepared and flavorful, the hamachi was sweet and tender.Surprisingly, the Burrata was the most memorable of this dining experience, as it was not seafood - what the restaurant is known for, the burrata was on top of a porcini mushroom conserva. There were two crispy chips on top of it with a rich balsamic. This dish was perfection.The Fiola Mare Lobster Ravioli is one of the staple of the restaurant. The sauce was creamy and buttery, there was a lobster tail, lobster claw and three raviolis filled with lobster, chives and ginger. For the price of $54, I think this dish is definitely something to try although it is quite expensive, it was hands down one of the best lobster ravioli I've tried before!We ordered an order of Brussels sprouts, the Brussels were broiled instead of the traditionally grilled like most restaurants. With slices of cheese and chives on top. Overall, the Brussels were good but I wouldn't get this side again.  Last but not least, dessert! We tried the Fiola Mare Warm Chocolate cake with a fudge core center, hazelnut gelato (amazing) and caramel tulie. The crispiness of the tulip warm chocolate cake and cold hazelnut gelato was a bite of heaven.It was a dream come true to be able to try Fiola Mare, it was a great and memorable experience. A very expensive restaurant but the food made it so worth it.",4,1,0,1

"Olivia N.","1/25/2018","Shepherdstown, WV","Cozy, wonderful setting. Love the vibe of this restaurant, upscale and happening. Very friendly, thorough staff. Sommelier, our waitress and the man assisting her were wonderful. We had the tuna tartar, half portion lobster ravioli, calamari, and burrata as appetizers. The calamari was my favorite app - with the slightest, most perfect char and standout seasonings. I ordered the seafood brodetto as my main. The different seafood was all cooked well, but the jus was darker, more concentrated than I expected (lacking brightness, kinda like a cooked down gumb? My fault for not knowing what I was ordering) and the presentation was somewhat lacking. I should have ordered the Oyster and Caviar as one of the apps and had the lobster ravioli as my main. My sister called from NOLA to surprise us with champagne and dessert, which they handled well. The cocktails and two bottles of wine our group enjoyed were on point, the guys were thrilled with their ""smoked"" whiskey drink. Would like to come back to brunch in nice weather.",4,0,0,0

"Jeremy K.","1/28/2018","Arlington, VA","My fiancee and I went to Fiola Mare for lunch during Restaurant Week.  We've been to several DC area restaurants for previous RWs and have had anywhere from terrible (Bistro Bistro) to great (Bastille, Pennsylvania 6) experiences.  This was far and away the best.  Incredible food and spectacular service made for a lovely, relaxing lunch.  Service:  Oftentimes, if you are dining at a very high end restaurant and are taking advantage of a deal like RW, you get lesser service and are distinctly rushed.  It was lunch, so we also didn't end up having drinks, another thing that has a tendency to make service decline.  In this case, we felt exactly the opposite.  Our waitress was warm, excited about the food she was selling, and just generally a great evangelist for the restaurant.  We felt like the most important people in her world, even though we were likely spending the least amount of money of anyone she served all day.Food:  Wow.  I was expecting great food, but some of what we had today was truly superlative.  We tried all six items on the RW menu:   butternut squash vellutata or a beet and citrus salad for the appetizers; poached branzino or ricotta cavatelli for the entrees; and tiramisu or vanilla and mandarin panna cotta for dessert.  -The vellutata (veloute) was delicious, with even my mushroom hating better half loving it despite the pronounced truffle oil flavor.  An almond crumble added some contrasting textures that really enhanced this creamy soup.-We had beet salad at home last night; I apparently need to up my game, because this was just so much better than my version.  The pickled red onions really made the dish.   -The branzino was cooked perfectly, though it wasn't the most exciting thing on the plate.  The farro, cooked risotto style, was tremendous.  With just a little hint of spice, it was so flavorful, beautifully cooked, and everything worked so well together.-As good as the branzino was, this carnivore was an even bigger fan of the cavatelli.  House made with ricotta in the dough, it was (there's a theme here) perfectly cooked, but even if it hadn't been, the sauce was so special that it wouldn't have mattered.  The waitress had informed us that it was great, but it was even better than I expected.  I would literally eat that sauce with some good bread for a week and be a happy man (with a developing weight gain issue, I'm sure).  It was creamy, rich, vibrant, and fresh in all the best ways possible.  The mushrooms were just the slightest bit chewy, which I liked because it provided a little contrast with the pasta.  This was one of the top five dishes I've ever eaten.-Tiramisu.  Who cares that crap is gross.  My fiancee liked it though, and it was super pretty.-The panna cotta was smooth, with absolutely no grit, with sweet and bright mandarin orange pieces and an ice on top, with crumbled meringue offering a crunchy mint topping that, yet again (more themes!) a texture contrast that enhanced the whole experience.  Fabio Trabocchi knows his stuff. We're planning to go back for a real splurge dinner at some point, and I cannot wait.",5,0,0,0
"Antonia N.","2/5/2018","Alexandria, VA","We really enjoyed our meal at Fiola Mare. The restaurant has a wonderful view on the waterfront in Georgetown. There is a lovely ambiance for a date night or special dinner. It was my birthday and the staff at Fiola Mare took great care of me! There was never an empty glass or a crumb on the table the whole meal.For our appetizers, we started off with the burrata which was a perfect plate of creamy burrata, lightly dressed greens and slivers of artichoke with a briny anchovy dressing. We also ordered the chestnut vellutata soup with lobster. It wasn't a standout of the meal, but it was good. For our entrees we had the lobster ravioli (of course) and chestnut fazzoletti. The lobster ravioli wasn't as good as it's been at Fiola, but it was still tasty. The fazzoletti on the other hand was delicious! Perfectly cooked pasta with a flavorful pork ragu and bits of salty prosciutto. Finally, dessert. There was some serious ""oooo'ing and awww'ing"" over the bomboloni - delicious, light, ricotta doughnuts with a toffee dipping sauce and maple ice cream. A perfect way to end the lovely meal!

"Christina S.","2/9/2018","Washington, DC","I don't know if it was because restaurant week rush died out or some other reason, I was able to get a reservation only a day before and the place was mostly empty when we dined. Most of the seats had a direct view to the waterfront, so great lighting if your camera eats before you do. They were also very thoughtful to place a blanket at each table.Let me start by saying the food was amazing! We both ordered their butternut squash vellutata because neither me nor my friend were a fan of beets. The aroma of butter flew straight to my nostrils as soon as the plates were brought to the table. The soup was blended perfectly with great consistency. It set the standard for the following courses. Then for entree, my friend had the branzino while I had the cavatelli. My friend was not that satisfied of the fish because the skin was left on. But I thought it was juicy and rich, great for a seafood lover. The portion for the pasta was very generous and the sauce was amazing. The cherry tomatoes added just the right amount of sweetness. The pasta was hand rolled and chewy. My only reservation about the main courses was that both choices were a bit too salty. We also tried both of their desserts. The panna cotta tasted very similar to the one at Fiola. I didn't know what to expect for the tiramisu but let's say I was pleasantly surprised. Presentation and taste were both much better than the one at Fiola. They piped the mascarpone on top, making it look kind of like a hedgehog. I've always been a sucker for aesthetics so the dessert scored extra points with me. The base was an infused chocolate cake that goes perfectly with the mascarpone. It was a great end to our lunch and I can't wait to return. There were two tables that ordered their seafood tower and I just couldn't stop gawking.

Our drinks were always filled constantly and our complimentary bubbly for our anniversary made our meal even better.We started with the San Giorgio which is the seafood tower, and the Burrata. Both appetizers were delicious. The oysters and the mussels were fresh and tasted great! The prawns and the langoustine were both equally delicious. They were cooked well and loved the whole presentation. We then ordered the lobster ravioli and the mixed grill seafood. The half portion of the lobsters consists of 1 ravioli and a medium sized piece of the lobster tail. Yes, this is pricey. However, the ravioli is bigger than the average size and it is filled with lobster meat. The sauce/broth that it comes in was also very tasty. Yes, we did ask for more bread so that we can dip it and eat it - just keeping it classy ;-) haha.The mixed grill consisted of calamari, lobster, branzino and a lagoustine (a smaller version of the lobster). All were cooked well and had a nice flavor to it. I mean I wasn't mad at it.For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and the bombolini. The tiramisu not only looked great, but also tasted great! Not too sweet, and perfect blend of all the ingredients. The bombolini was also tasty and soft and perfectly fried. I mean if you're gonna eat a doughnut, eat this one.All in all we definitely felt that this restaurant had thought out all the different aspects of a diner's experience. Definitely worth a try.",5,2,1,1

Pictured: squid ink bucatini, lobster ravioli (full portion), and tiramisu. As someone from the south, I value good service and that is something guaranteed here. Our server Dorin was one of the best that I have had in a while. Here you were made to feel more like family while being able to experience the most incredible food you'll ever have.

"Dori A.","3/4/2018","New York, NY","I came here with my parents for my birthday dinner.  Definitely a great place to go for a special birthday, anniversary, graduation, etc.  The meal was delicious with excellent service.  It is a pretty fancy place, fine dining place.  Definitely not cheap, but the food is super high quality.  The whole experience (including atmosphere, food and drink quality, and service) make the pricing worth it.The drinks here are fabulous.  I got the Bellagio and highly recommend it!  They also have a huge wine list.  We couldn't decide which wine to order, so our waiter sent over the sommelier who was very sweet.We got the Japanese Uni crude because we weren't super familiar with Uni and wanted to try something new.  It was good, but a bit salty (I think this is a characteristic of the fish itself, so it's not the restaurant to blame).  The insalata del contadino sounded like it would be a semi-standard salad, but it was SOOO delicious!! Surpassed any ""standard"" salad (not sure why I even thought that in the first place).  For our entrees, we got the seafood brodetto, halibut, and bronzino.  All were fantastic.  Perhaps best of all was the Fiola Warm Chocolate Cake dessert.  I literally wanted to lick the plate!  The combination of the cake with hazelnut gelato was to die for.A wonderful birthday dinner!",5,0,0,0
"Sypress P.","3/4/2018","Clinton, MD","Sophisticated classic brunch menu with modern twists that are cool but not weird or so over the top you can't enjoy. This spot has everything- waterfront dining ambiance, amazing food and the highest level of service.Scott was not only attentive but knowledgeable and had the pleasant personality to add the overall dining experience. He was able to manage a large group handily and patiently even during the busy brunch service. We felt like his only table and the attention was appreciated.The food is a class act. The lemon croissants are really sweet with a yummy filling. The yellow fin carpaccio was fresh, topped with fresh herbs and melts in your mouth. The lobster ravioli is worth a trip into town and every penny. The simply grilled branzino isn't much to look at but, the salsa verde and garlic spinach are delicious.Please don't skip desert. We had a large group so I sampled the fried donuts, chocolate fudge like bar with pistachio cream and sea salt ( there is a fancy name) and the tiramisu. Every single one was worth the calories.

"Kristie F.","3/13/2018","Chevy Chase, MD","I have had the pleasure of dining at Fiola Mare several times (once for work, twice for birthday celebrations) and the food and ambiance are always on point. That said our last dining experience has really soured this restaurant for me.  My husband and I were meeting with a potential candidate for his company - we wanted to show him the best of what DC has to offer & the Georgetown waterfront is always a plus. I rushed in to meet our group & quickly ordered a glass of prosecco from the bar (I made a mental note that it was $12 a glass).  Once we were seated I ordered another glass with dinner.  Fast forward to today with my husband processing his expenses, he calls me, extremely annoyed, to let me know that my choice of beverage was $34 a glass (which also happens to be the most expensive glass of bubbly on their menu).  Perhaps if we were celebrating a special occasion I would have justified spending roughly $70 for TWO glasses of fizz, but as it was not the case I can't help but feel a bit swindled...just a heads up to always make sure you are being charged correctly & receive what you ordered.  Lesson learned!",1,1,0,0

"Dannie W.","3/23/2018","Boston, MA","The Ancona is amazing. The seafood here is very fresh. I like the tiger prawns, sea urchin, and scallops the most. It's the best raw bar I've ever had. This one is big enough for 2 and I feel I'm almost full with this dish. The cocktails are good too. I tried the Riviera, it tastes good and looks beautiful. It's definitely good for ladies. Jiggity Jig looks fun. They light up the cinnamon outside the glass. For dinner, I tried ADRIATIC SEAFOOD BRODETTO ($54) It has Monkfish, Branzino, Sea Bream, Langoustine, and Saffron Jus. I think it's ordinary. They pour the soup over the seafood right after they serve the food. I don't like the soup too much though. For dessert, I tried the coppeta (3 scoops of sorbetto). It's ordinary. Usually sorbet is my favorite dessert but I don't think I like it here. They are not pure fruity flavor and that's why I don't like it. The wine is good. The service is good. I like that they put a blanket on the window seats as it's cold in the winter time. If I come next time, I'll probably just order the drinks and Ancona.",4,0,0,0
"Kate Z.","3/24/2018","Washington, DC","I had a wonderful Saturday brunch here with a friend.  We sat by the windows facing the water, with the sun in our hair.  The food was delicious.  We tried the San Giorgio (fresh oysters, clams, tiger prawn, mussels, langoustine, with divine tuna tartare), lobster ravioli (the sauce was so buttery and melt in your mouth good that we asked for bread to dip it in), tiramisu, and bomboloni (doughnuts with fudge sauce and vanilla gelato, yum). What elevated the experience even more was the service.  Carlos S was very welcoming, responsive, and knowledgeable.  For example, we were thinking of ordering the signature brunch but we also wanted to try the San Giorgio.  Most places would have said we both had to order the signature brunch, but Carlos was flexible and suggested that we order the San Giorgio and one of the items on the signature brunch to start.  If we were still hungry afterward, we could order other parts of the signature brunch.  Problem solved.  And when we asked about dessert, he said he already ordered some for us on the house.  It really is moments like this (and several others) during our brunch that made the experience memorable and special.  I look forward to returning.",5,0,0,0
"Alexandra B.","3/28/2018","Wilton, CT","Came here for my birthday last year, and was super excited to try the Lobster Ravioli. I had a reservation for 8pm, but they were running extremely late. We weren't seated until around 9pm. Yes, they tried to make this up to us by giving us free food and appetizers and by passing around champagne while we were waiting, but it still doesn't ignore the fact that they were running over an HOUR behind schedule. It was also packed, which made it uncomfortable to just wait around. I kept on getting pushed by people left and right. As for the food, it's good. The lobster ravioli was good, but I didn't think it was worth the hype. They also had a truffle risotto special, which was out of this world. Honestly can't remember what else we ordered, but the service was good, the decor is beautiful, and the food is good. Probably won't be back, but I wouldn't be opposed to dining here.",4,2,0,1

"Nicole A.","4/9/2018","Denver, CO","Traveling to DC for a trip with my parents I had read so many amazing reviews about this restaurant. We went to dinner upon arriving in the city and we actually had an amazing experience. The food was delicious and the people were really nice. I was informed about the dress code upon calling for a table. I was told NO athletic gear and or torn clothing. I am leaving a negative review because just 2 days later, after walking around the whole city, checking out the monuments, and shopping, we wanted to stop in for a drink at the bar since we had such a great experience just 2 nights before. It was 5pm and we were in casual street/city wear. Great jeans, sweaters and boots. My dad was wearing his veterans hat as he is a colonel in the Army and has served our country for 30 Years. Upon entering and asking to have some drinks, a man rushed forwards, looked my parents up and down and said ""We have a strict dress code and you don't meet it"", his tone was judgmental and rude and we hadn't even taken our coats off so he had no idea what we were wearing.

The seafood there was fresh and every bit seasoned to perfection. I love the bucatini that I ordered although I typically prefer my shrimp to be a little bit more cooked. I think that was just how they prepare it which wasn't bad. Either way, my stomach left there pretty happy and satisfied.When you're there, you have to order the princess sakura drink. Even though I don't drink, the presentation was so instagrammable. It's a mixture of vodka, sake, cherry blossom, peach, yuzu and they bring it out on a tray with perfumed lavender to add the final touch.

It was OK, but I don't know if the price warranted what was served.  I felt the oysters tasted mediocre.  We shared the $50 lobster ravioli dish.  Somehow that dish didn't pop out at me either. It was a bit salty, and definitely didn't warrant the price tag either.  We got the special dessert at the end, and wow we are talking about $30 for doughnuts!  I mean literally just sugared doughnuts that you could dip with hazelnut? I'm almost embarrassed to say they taste like the sugared kind you get at the Chinese buffet.  Food-wise it was disappointing for the price tag.  The view was beautiful.  It was a classy place to be, and I didn't know about the valet parking in front of the restaurant either.  Servers were excellent and very professional.",3,1,0,0

Especially with the salsa verde sauce it came with...my mouth is still watering! We devoured it. For our entrees, Hubby and I each ordered the lobster ravioli (their signature dish). From the pictures on yelp it doesn't look like a lot, but it was super filling! It came with three raviolis filled to the max with lobster and then even more meat swimming around in the incredible ginger/cream sauce. We both only ate about half because the restaurant also gave us salmon on the house to help celebrate!!! That was also another tasty dish (and also came with the salsa verde). We were pretty full but of course still had room for dessert. We ordered the ricotta donuts with salted caramel sauce and banana sorbet...YUMMMM! The sweet, salty, and tanginess of it all blended so well together. I found myself licking my lips after each bite to really savor the flavors. Aaaaand Fiola Mare also threw in a lemon cake and a couple of chocolates! I was in heaven. As the cherry on top, Hubby let me enjoy the extra sweets on my own...no sharing! I knew I married him for a reason ;-). Anyway, I totally recommend this place! Get the grilled calamari; you'll thank me for it.

"Sara P.","5/5/2018","Reston, VA","Terribly overpriced for mediocre, appetizer-sized entrees.  This place only stands out for its food presentation, unusual ingredients, and the ""view"".  I was not impressed by the view, unless you want to see tourists boarding noisy boats right near the tables and very loud helicopters flying over often.  I had a ravioli (single) with duck egg yolk and mushrooms for $24, and it was too salty.  I'm a small woman and I left hungry.  They don't even offer bread, but I guess they're too high-end for that and I was supposed to order other dishes or the $48 full course meal. Strange they don't have a lunch menu and offer only brunch in the afternoon.Service was surprisingly subpar.  I could barely hear the young waiter who got our drink orders, and our main waiter forgot one of the dishes we ordered.  It started raining and the employees were not very helpful in moving us out of the rain.  They thought moving our table so we were literally back-to-back with people at an adjacent table was acceptable.Tip: if you sit outside, use the bathroom before you're seated because it's a long walk back to the entrance where the bathrooms are.",2,1,0,0

The weather was just perfect so the patio was lovely. Service was top notch, they even offered me a blanket to cover my shoulders towards the end of the night when it got slightly chilly outside. We started with the San Georgio seafood tower. The highlight of this tower were definitely the prawns, they were ginormous!! They were very meaty and delicious. The oysters and mussels on the tower were good as well, but I liked the prawns a lot more. We then shared the Lobster Ravioli and Mixed Grilled Seafood for our entrees. The lobster ravioli's were like little pockets of seafoody heaven. Although the dish only came with 3 raviolis, they were each filled with succulent lobster meat. The ravioli itself was so thin and delicate, it almost reminded me of a chinese wonton wrapper. I fell in love instantly and thought nothing could beat this dish!!...until we moved onto the mixed grilled seafood. My oh my....this dish came with half a lobster, one prawn, calamari, and piece of branzino. THIS was definitely my favorite of the night. Everything was cooked to perfection, especially the calamari and branzino! Simply marinated in olive oil and salt but oh so flavorful and tender.

Shout-out to our server Doug for all the good recs and the fabulous service.We started with the trio of tartare which was beautifully presented. I especially loved the Asian flavors of the prawns. The salmon was fine but wasn't super flavorful. We also ordered the grilled calamari as an appetizer which is a must-have. The regular portion is huge, even for two people to share as an appetizer. I would recommend sharing as an appetizer for 3 or getting the half-size for 2.For our entrees, I ordered the lobster ravioli. Instead of traditional ravioli dough, the chef used wonton papers which went perfectly with the lobster. These raviolis are not to be messed with. They are stuffed to the max and the ginger and chive sauce is phenomenal. Plus the 3 raviolis came with huge pieces of lobster. My only complaint here was there the lobster was a little tough. I had a hard time cutting it with my butter knife. My lunch date got the salmon which looked beautiful although I didn't try it.To finish, I ordered the bombolini which were ricotta doughnuts that were cooked to perfection. The cappuccino to accompany the doughnuts was a good choice as it complemented the caramel source...also...I had to go back to work.Fiola Mare is a must-try in DC.

"Frank N.","5/22/2018","Santa Fe, NM","This was perhaps the most exquisite meal I've ever had. Everything was near perfection from the moment we pulled up to the parking valet.Our dinner was a family celebration for our college graduate son, and after several long days of ceremonies, parties, and receptions, we were looking to relax and be pampered with good food and service.  Fiola Mare delivered on all fronts. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, and as we entered we were escorted to a large table in the cozy and comfortable back room.  We started with a round of unique cocktails expertly made by the bartender. From there we moved onto shared appetizers of the Burrata with Fried Prosciutto and the Hamachi.  Both were excellent, but the Burrata was better than anything I've ever had before; so light and creamy in texture.For main courses, we had the smoked potato gnocchi, the grilled Branzino and the grilled Mahi Mahi, accompanied by sides of wilted spinach and crushed smoked potatoes.  We ordered a nice bottle of a Super Tuscan wine with the assistance of their Sommelier. Everything was just fresh and delicious. It's rare that everyone in our family will rave about their meals!We normally don't eat dessert, but this being a special occasion, we ordered tiramisu, and our thoughtful server brought out two additional complementary desserts to help us celebrate! Don't miss the Bomboloni if you have room.To enjoy this wonderful restaurant, you must be prepared to spend some money.  Fiola Mare is probably the most expensive restaurant I've ever been to, and for most people not on an expense account it would be considered a luxurious special occasion restaurant.

"Michele G.","5/23/2018","Jackson Hole, WY","Wonderful setting .... right by the Potomac and overlooking the Kennedy center. Service was fairly attentive. Went there for lunch today ... Sadly the arugula salad and my parent's starter appetizer of shrimp was not very tasteful - rather bland. (Next time bring out the cocktail sauce!!) The ""Alaskan"" salmon was most likely farm raised though it was fine. (Bring more of the delicious sauce that is dubbed on the plate). The mango/ apricot desert was delicious. I shall return but will likely be more demanding of the food. Coming from Los Angeles, I was surprised that valet parking was  $16 (more than I expected). Didn't know Georgetown parking was so elevated - my bad perhaps.  Like I said, beautiful setting and ambiance ...",3,1,0,0

"Brittanie W.","5/27/2018","Columbus, GA","Absolutely loved this place for brunch !! Brought my parents and while we did have a 1300 reservation they were more than willing to make seat us earlier and in a prime location with shade and breeze. The gentleman tending to us explained the menu, providing in-depth explanations of dishes and drinks. With orders placed everything was brought promptly. The brunch option (not chosen by me but my parents loved it) was wonderful since you received a drink (selection is listed), appetizer, entree, and desert (all chosen at once). My father realized he wanted doughnuts over the tiramisu and they happily obliged us. Let me say now, it was a fantastic choice to switch!! While the tiramisu looked interesting, it had a more deconstructed look, less layering and the doughnuts came with ice cream and chocolate drizzle. I ordered the San Giogiro and it was phenomenal. While two people could enjoy it as a starter, I was famished and did not share an ounce of it with my parents. I think a few of the reminders we had to place concerning water and my coffee was never brought at the end, but otherwise it was an exceptional visit and I will definitely return next time I am in Georgetown.",4,0,0,0

"Yaz H.","6/1/2018","Washington, DC","Situated perfectly on my way home from work, Fiola Mare was an easy sell when it opened. The location is an absolute gem: not only does this grand dame of the Georgetown waterfront bestride the boardwalk, it occupies a particularly picturesque spot right where the Potomac hooks west. That means stunning views of Roosevelt Island and Key Bridge from the vibrant front bar, where I love to ensconce myself for the festive happy hour. There's something magical about the ethereal balance between natural and artificial light just before the sun sets, if you can grab that moment. (The little ""Bar Piccolo"" in the back is also lovely, especially for a nightcap.) From the plush, white leather cushions on the chair to the curving marble bar and the hanging shelves, the front bar exudes class, as you'd expect from any Trabocchi establishment. And Freddy, Edwin and the whole bar crew are both impeccable in their thoughtfulness and just such cheerful conversationalists. I'll dawdle for hours here on weekends if my girlfriend is away, or when I'm catching up with an old friend. Wines by the glass are carefully curated: the Super Tuscan is big and rounded, not tart; the dry Prosecco refreshes you on a warm night. Cocktails are also crafted with care and imagination. The Sapore Vero is one of my favorites, while the Negroni is hard to beat in the sweltering summer.I don't dine here often but you cannot go wrong with a pound of the tender calamari, grilled with spartan simplicity in a deliciously savory broth. The ricotta cavatelli also ranks with the most amazing dishes I've had here, with a tart ragu that punctuates the fresh pasta.Whether you're gathering with colleagues after work or enjoying a gals/guys' night out, you'd be hard pressed to find a classier spot with the refined bustle you'll find here. I told my peeps there that while I've loved Del Mar the handful of times I've been to date, Fiola Mare will always be closer--both to home and to the heart.",5,2,0,0

First of all, it was right in front of the water and even though the day was rainy and gloomy, the ambiance of the place made up for the terrible weather. It was cozy and the lighting was bright and airy. The service was great and they made sure they attended to all of our needs and since it was my birthday, they made me feel extra special. They gave my boyfriend and me a glass of champagne, a letter from the chef, and a birthday dessert. I thought it was so thoughtful and nice. We ordered the seafood tower, which was filled with so many goodies. When I initially saw it, I thought it was a small portion, but as we dug in I realized the portion was a lot bigger than I thought. There was so much seafood on the platter. Not to mention the presentation was beautiful. We ordered a bottle of champagne and at the end ordered dessert wine and a dessert. Everything was delicious and I would recommend this place if you are trying to celebrate a special occasion.",5,1,0,1

When we had mentioned that it was not warm, he did not assist us to get what we had asked for. Secondly, I had asked for 2 glasses of the house Cabernet and the bill reflected that 2 glasses was $64... when I had asked the bartender why it was that much, he had told me that he had given us the house cab but that he had also taken care of other drinks for us. The glass of white wine I had was $12..

When he found out that it was my birthday, he brought us free appetizer and free dessert. Our food was about an hour late but the waiter kept apologizing for it. Though, we were so deep in our conversations that we didn't even realize the passage of time. He even gave us a free bottle of white wine because our food was delayed. Also about the food itself!

"Kayla C.","7/3/2018","Randolph, NJ","Came here with a larger group celebrating a graduation. They have a prime location right on the water, but in order to accommodate our larger group they saw us towards the back room. The separate room was perfect for a large group like us though, because it was much more spacious and conducive for conversations.A must here is the seafood tower. It's one of the best I've had. For the entree I'd say the Adriatic Mixed Seafood Grill was the most impressive, but really if you like seafood you can't go wrong with the selection here.The only reason for four stars was their reservation system. When we originally called the restaurant to increase the reservation by 1 person (2 days before the dinner date), the person managing the system gave us a really hard time saying that they can not accommodate this. The person managing the reservations was not on site because their system is completely online. We had to drive to the restaurant and speak to the host directly in order to accommodate our party. It was rather inconvenient, but glad it was all sorted out.",4,0,0,0
"Yasmine B.","7/3/2018","Arlington, VA","Fantastic! It was an early-birthday celebration for my mom-away-from-home and we went to Fiola Mare for lunch. Right by the Georgetown waterfront this restaurant is accessible by bus or cab/uber/lyft. Fiola has several lunch options - there is a Mediterranean low-calorie set lunch (asparagus-monkfish-light dessert) for $28 and the same plus other items are available a la carte. We did the set menu and it was just right. The monkfish comes with a sauce that is slightly spicy - but it works. The accompanying garlic scape is a little difficult to cut with the fish knife - so as unique of a touch as it is, I would have probably either chopped it up or used another garnish / vegetable accent.And by the way - the bread and olive oil is incredible - they know what's up at this place!This the place to go for a leisurely lunch. The service is impeccable - unhurried, courteous and attentive. And they brought out a candle on the dessert for my mom - always a nice gesture :)",4,1,1,1

My wife asked if they had a sparkling rose and was told yes. She ordered it and we enjoyed our drinks. When the tab came, it was for $44.  We then learned for the first time that the sparkling rose not only was not on the happy hour deal but was $34 a glass.  No one mentioned that fact in advance.  Who trains their people to rip off customers like that?  Shame on you, Fabio.",1,1,0,0

"Emily H.","7/9/2018","Baltimore, MD","This place is great..if you want a snooty, overpriced dinner. They are not accommodating at all and seem to hate dogs!

When I did arrive, they had so much outdoor seating and more than half the tables were empty. It was also strange when you call they ask what restaurant you are calling about so it doesn't seem like the line goes directly to the restaurant and the person answering is not onsite. My family got there ahead of time and sat outdoors in an area where they reassured them dogs would be okay but when I was entering from the side with my dog the bouncer stopped me before I even found my family and pointed at my 5 pound dog and said 'that's going to be a problem.' So rude! Our waitress was nice and very accommodating but the managers and other wait staff were glaring and rolling their eyes at us! Very snobby.

However, our experience with all things food - from the wine selection to the incredibly fresh and diverse seafood offerings - was pretty great. We started with the trio of oysters and two other crudos, and the selection was perfection with the sweeter oysters from the Pacific to the brinier ones from Maine. The dipping sauces were also very complimentary to each of the different types of oysters. My husband and I shared the adriatic mixed platter, which was huge, as well as the black truffle pasta (probably one of the best things I've ever eaten)...

"Mary Kate E.","7/17/2018","Nashville, TN","I have been wanting to try Fiola Mare for as long as I can remember. It took me moving in 2 weeks for me to finally bite the budget bullet to go in, and in doing so - I went twice. Once with my friend for drinks and the other to solo. Both times I enjoyed.The menu isn't for everyone. It has a lot of emphasis on mushrooms and spices. For someone who can't do a lot of spice and doesn't prefer mushrooms, it took me a minute to find something that I liked. I settled on the scallops for the meal plus a glass of wine. I really liked it, and though the menu listing looked like it had conflicting ingredients, but honestly, they harmonized really well. It was delish.My server on my solo night was okay. I wasn't blown away by her service. She definitely was more engaging with the table of 4 who bought 2 bottles of wine and a full spread than me. I kind of expected that though, so I was not too terribly surprised.Coming here on a Saturday night opposed to a Tuesday night are 2 different types of settings as one can imagine. Coming on a Saturday late night when the bar is the only place to get a seat is perfect if you enjoy people watching. My friend I enjoyed watching the people around us chat. In particular, we sat a couple of seats away from an older gentleman and his very young date who left very little to the imagination. My friend who is a Georgetown local said she would not be in the least bit surprised if she was the ""lady of the evening."" He caressed her shoulder with his hand and kissed her every so often on the cheek. It was very interesting watching their body language, but again, you couldn't help but to watch. The 2 ladies next to us mentioned they overheard them saying they were headed to Top of the Gate. Again, not that we really cared, but you just knew he was pulling out all the stops for this chick. The bartenders are very entertaining. They are very engaging and fun all while offering intellectual conversation. Let's not forget that there was NOT a single ugly person behind their bar. Everyone was pretty in Fiola Mare! Compliments of the bartenders, everyone at the bar got a free flute of prosecco. They cheered us and we appreciated the kind gesture.Ladies - wear close toed shoes after 9. They do not really have a strict dress code other than upscale casual before 9, but if you're dressed down to any capacity, you will not be admitted.Fiola Mare, I am happy I tried you out. I enjoyed my experiences, but you are definitely more of a Saturday night drinks/apps type place for me than full dinner menu unless it is one someone else's tab. My guess if you spend more money, you're going to get more attention.",4,8,4,8

The service impeccable. Our waiter was so very knowledgeable in terms of the menu. He described everything with such great detail we were able to make our dinner choices with confidence and ease. Oh and the drinks were a whole other level of delicious, plus after one drink somehow I had a buzz..they weren't watered down and seemingly every aspect of the cocktails were made in house and crafted with extreme care and awareness of what tastes good together. My gf had the lobster ravioli and she doesnt normally enjoy lobster. It was startlingly impressive. The flavor was beyond description and truthfully I feel any word I tried to use would do it no justice and almost be disrespectful. I had the seafood grill, served on a copper pan with the pan juices on 2 small flames. This dish included langostino, scallops, calamari and branzino fish, again, no words can properly summarize the level and depth of flavor but I was full halfway thru the meal...for me that means true satisfaction and my brain registered it as such.

"Audrey M.","7/23/2018","Arlington, VA","My bff and I enjoyed a fabulous brunch here last weekend. We sat outside on the patio (despite the creeping humidity...our mistake), and both opted for the $48 signature brunch, which includes a cocktail, lemon croissant, and choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. This is such an incredible steal, given the portion sizes and quality. We went with the following - Tuna tartare (fresh, not diced too finely, loved the crema); Burrata (super creamy, utterly delicious); Carbonara ravioli (inventive, decadent, a tad salty); Shrimp in potacchio (flavorful, creamy, loved the addition of guanciale aka BACON, a bit strong on the tabasco); Tiramisu (can't go wrong with this classic); Bomboloni (hot, fresh, unbelievably soft donut holes with a side of warm chocolate dipping sauce...heavenly). We were also mistakenly brought the Gragnano spaghetti alla granseola, which our server graciously told us to enjoy on the house...and oh, did we enjoy it. Savory chunks of crab, tomato, and thin slices of garlic is an unbeatable combo. We both chose the bloody mary to accompany our meals, and they were strong, spicy, and well garnished. My friend commented on the awkward shape of the glass making it difficult to drink, but it could also be a matter of personal preference. I do wish I had gone with a mimosa or bellini to offset the richness (and tomato sauces) of all the food. Our server, Douglas (if I remember correctly) was fantastic - polite, friendly, attentive without being overbearing. He made a lovely experience that much nicer.

"Kimi S.","7/27/2018","Vienna, VA","It's been a few years since Fiola Mare hit the scene but it's still as popular as ever. When a friend recently requested waterfront views and oysters for her birthday brunch, we immediately knew this would be the perfect place.The inside of the restaurant is quite beautiful but their expansive patio is the place to be. Besides the sweeping views of the Potomac and waterfront breeze, it's one of the best people watching spots in town.You can order a la carte here, but for $50 you are allowed a cocktail, pastry, appetizer, entree and dessert off the menu. It's an awesome deal and something that I definitely recommend. I absolutely loved my Sunny Day Mocktail which was made with lavender syrup and my pastry was a filled lemon cruffin which was absolutely worth every single carb.For an appetizer, I was torn between the gazpacho and the oysters which was surprisingly included in the brunch deal. I went with the gazpacho which had a lovely presentation and was delightful on the tongue. The crab cakes benedict was the only item I was really disappointed in -- it was more like one or two small pieces of crab swimming in Hollandaise than an actual crab cake. The English muffin was also super chewy and dense, no airy nooks and crannies. Since we had made note that it was a birthday, the server came back with a glass of champagne for everyone which was a sweet and much appreciated gesture. Just a note -- it is quite easy to get a reservation here but boy do they take things seriously! There is a $50 per person cancellation fee (if you cancel less than 24 hours in advance) and they will message you multiple times to remind you about the restaurant dress code (which of course, is not enforced thank goodness).",4,15,2,14

That was beginning of the total unthinkingness of this place. Then they for real served rotten mussels in an overcooked pasta dish that was supposed to clam pasta. When we pointed out the downgrade in preparation they basically just apologized for getting caught. As a final act, they bought out two strange desserts that we didn't want. They never offered us the list for desserts and instead they just comped the pasta brought the desserts and called it a day.

"Anthony W.","8/25/2018","Manhattan, NY","A chance to have a rare night with the family.We started with a round of cocktails and for me as a fan of bourbon, the Brigantina delivered.We started with the San Benedetto. Decadent doesn't begin to describe this mountain of clams, mussles, oysters, prawns, lobster, king crab, tuna tartare, caviar and sea urchin! All breathtakingly fresh and more than enough for the 6 of us. We barely finished it and still had our main courses to go.I had the Bucatini served with Spanish Red King prawns and sea urchin. Fiery looking, but mild in taste with the urchin providing an earthy umami undertone and the bucatini itself pefectly al dente..If you prefer a little spice, I'd also recommend the Tagliolini since the Nduja sausage brings some heat to compliment the succulent octupus and mussels.The seas scallop special was also extremely good.Wonderful, attentive service and a picturesque location on the waterfront! Amazing!A family reunion is a special occasion that calls for a special venue. If you are so fortunate, Fiola Mare is a restaurant that more than fulfills your dreams and expectations. First rate and highly recommended!",5,0,0,0
"Daisy d.","8/27/2018","Washington, DC","Fiola Mare _was_ one of my favorite spots for dinner and brunch. I have always loved the service we received from the staff, the somm, and general manager. Whenever we had a special occasion, I always considered this place. I took a long break from this place simply because there were so many awesome restaurants popping up in the District and I wanted to give them a try.I recently returned to Fiola Mare for brunch with my friends. While I would have rated this restaurant with five stars back in those days when food, service, and ambiance deserved the high markings, my recent visit changed that.Our server was a bit condescending.It started when our server asked for our drinks. I requested for an Aperol Spritz garnished with both an orange slice and skewered olives. He looked at me quizzically so I repeated my order. Then he said, ""that sounds disgusting, but okay,"" chuckled and shrugged his shoulders, referring to the fact that I wanted olives in my spritz. What this man didn't realize was that the style of spritz I ordered is how spritzes are actually served all over Italy, and is commonly referred to as a Venetian Spritz. Nevertheless, I should be able to order my drink the way I want without  question, let alone condescension.Then, when we placed our food orders, I requested that they pace the serving so that our actual meals arrive with enough space after our appetizers. Even in high-end restaurants, they can sometimes rush the dishes, so I simply wanted it to be known that there was no rush on getting our food all at once. Again, in a condescending manner, he responded with, ""Naturally,"" as if my statement was unwanted.If you're still reading this review at this point, you might ask why I simply didn't rate this place with two stars.The reason I didn't rate this visit with a lower rating is because of the food and our time with the somm, as well as weighing the other times I've been here where the service and cuisine combined made the visit worthwhile.The food was just as I remembered -- delicious and well-prepared. The pasta and all the other ingredients with it were fresh and flavorful. The grilled calamari was divine! The sauce was so good we took the bread to sop it in the sauce. Mmmm...Our somm was patient and helpful with our wine selection. We chose a beautiful bottle of Pinot Noir from Russian River Valley, and enjoyed it along with our meals.In conclusion, I have no plans to rush back to this place. There are plenty of other restaurants in D.C. that can deliver quality foods, exquisite wines, and stellar service, all at the same time, without costing you an arm and a leg. To find out, see my other reviews.",3,4,0,1

Similar names and very different restaurants. I like, in particular, the more laid back vibe of Fiola Mare.I ordered a raw fish appetizer that was better than what I have experienced at top sushi restaurants in DC.  Next was Sea Bass perfectly grilled.  Service was absolutely perfect.

We had an order of the capital oysters which was a little different but WOW! Everything we ate here was completely mouth watering, it is a bit on the pricy side but i believe when it comes to an experience you can't put a price on it.

They were patient and happily worked towards a solution that met our needs so we could still eat.When we arrived, we sat outside. When bees and crowd noise started to impact our experience, they happily moved us inside to a nice a peaceful place. (I believe the name of the person helping us was Darina or Derina... Whoever she is, she made my wife and me feel very important and she is part of the reason why I looked really good last night when we celebrated our anniversary.)When we were served dessert, we received a note card from management and the owners greeting us a happy anniversary.

"Rifkah S.","10/6/2018","Bryn Mawr, PA","Romantic Italian Seafood inspired restaurant  located on the D.C. waterfront. The atmosphere is softly lite and warm with both banquette seating further indoors & semi outdoor/patio seating along the outer rims of the dining room. This visit we were seated in the banquette section which is less intimate. The staff are well trained & not overly intrusive. The food is well plated and prepared, all enhancing the natural beauty and flavors of the sea. The seafood tower was a highlight of the meal and a must have. This is a fairly expensive restaurant but well worth it if you are a fan of simply prepared seafood. The only detractor is it could stand to have some more vegetable offerings.

"Alexis G.","11/1/2018","Washington, DC","Beautiful restaurant right off Georgetown waterfront! But listen to those dollar signs on yelp. Came here on a whim with my boyfriend and thankfully and unawarely we fit their dress code policy. No sweat pants here guys lol. We didn't have a reservation so it was either sit outside on a somewhat chilly night or by the bar. The bar was pretty crowded so decided to go sit outside, we have scarfs and thought we could tough it out. Thankfully they offer blankets but I definitely think Fiola Mare should invest in some outside heat lamps at least if I'm pay $200+ to eat here. Anyway we were sat quickly and served water right away. Our server Aaron Rogers, what a guy and sales man lol. If you get him be careful of your wallets cause he'll get you to drop some cash! All the food here was delicious and a total experience. Their change their menu often so if you go today, you'll have something completely different next week which is pretty fun.

"Brent B.","11/29/2018","Arlington, VA","5 stars for a magnificent Georgetown Italian restaurant.When it comes to dining in Georgetown, there are many Italian options. However, the one that stands out above the rest is Fiola Mare. Located on K Street at The Washington Harbour, Fiola Mare is known as the place to eat and be seen. While other upscale DC restaurants don't always deliver, Fiola Mare lives up to the hype.We dined at Fiola Mare for lunch recently. Once we entered the venue, we saw a beautiful bar to our left, a coat check area to our right and a large open concept restaurant (with a great view of the kitchen) in front of us. The server took us to a table on the enclosed patio area so that we could start our meal with a great view of the Potomac.Our server came over to give us menus and let us know about specials. He was generally a good server, although his Sybrian accent made him a little difficult to understand at times and his serving not as urgent as we would have liked at lunch on a work day. To be fair, most Italian dining experiences last a little longer than normal, and the support staff helping him was very good.We started out our lunch with drinks and an appetizer. I got the Wishful Thinking, which was a wonderful scotch-based cocktail. The appetizer we picked was the 1 lb of calamari. It was perfectly cooked and could easily be shared as an entree for two (good thing we hadn't eaten for about a day!).In terms of the rest of the meal, I ordered the Maria lunch special, which includes a salad, cod and a fun dessert. My wife ordered a half serving of the king lobster spaghetti (which was very reasonably priced). We shared these dishes and enjoyed them all. The salad included a great dressing, the cod included lemon drops that were to die for, the lobster spaghetti was tasty, and the dessert was a great way to finish the meal.Overall, Fiola Mare is the quintessential upscale Italian experience. The atmosphere, service and food rival many comparable places in NYC. If you are looking to try some of the best of Georgetown (and DC in general), definitely consider giving this venue a try.",5,12,2,15

"Heather B.","12/9/2018","Decatur, GA","Five stars for lovely views, professional service and great food options.This restaurant is located in the Washington Harbor plaza and has lovely views and a great bar. The interior of the restaurant is tasteful and has a slight nautical theme. The service is formal and a bit aloof, perfect for business meetings. As I work in the area, I've been for lunch and for cocktails. The bar tenders are terrific and put a lot of effort into each drink. The same service at the tables carries through at the bar. My favorite dish overall is the calamari. At lunch, you get an entire pound of marinaded, grilled calamari and it is phenomenal. Perfectly tender and extremely flavorful. Bonus, it's only $26. Definitely large enough to share amongst four people as an appetizer.At lunch, there's a three course option of reasonably healthy food for only around $30. It comes with salad, an entree and an interesting dessert. This is a great value and very tasty.Overall, Fiola Mare offers an excellent upscale dining experience with traditional servers and great seafood.

Opens promptly for their business hours.  Otherwise prepare to sit at the bar for a few minutes. We were seated near the window to take in the scenery. Nice... some of the menu is a lot of Hoity-toity gourmet food jargon. We ordered the appetizer of the fresh seafood. I knew I was in trouble when they introduced us to the langoustines (freshly flown in) and the oyster. This was going to cost me a ""grip"". Quality of the selected variety of seafoods was amazing. Great flavor.  Not a lot of food but it WAS the appetizer. $140 and we were just getting started. Risotto, gragnano spaghetti, veal chop and salmon. Big plates, small portions but done well. Ordered a slice of cake for dessert. Disappointed in the sliver and done with no flair thought I'd asked for it as a birthday extra. Ah well.... All in all $500 before tip. We stopped after dinner and got some Georgetown cupcakes and needed a few snacks when we got home. Nice dinner experience but do NOT plan to get FULL here. Not likely to return.

From coat check to the point at which we were seated with dated ""happy anniversary"" menus and a handwritten note thanking us for sharing our special day with them, we knew we were in for an experience.The food was even better than expected. From yellowfin tuna tartar to lobster ravioli and whole fish to the various deserts, each plate both exceeded our expectations for the base dish but then proceeded to wow with unexpected notes of sweet/salt/savory/smokey goodness that made individual bites an experience unto themselves. Our 9-year-old (a bit of a foodie in the making) was joining us for the ""date night"" and her mood was visibly  brightened by the service and food quality. At points, she couldn't stop smiling at the amazing flavors, attentive service, and beautiful riverside setting, telling us giddily that ""it all just makes [her] so happy.""As a client-experience-obsessed leader, I must say that everything about the evening impressed. Such an orchestrated effort to please a customer/guest is never a fluke, and the consistency throughout our visit left us wowed by the amount of training, effort, practice, skill, and--most of all--sincere care that was demonstrated throughout our brief stay in the hands of the Fiola Mare Team.

"Carolyn H.","2/21/2019","Potomac, MD","Consistently superb food and excellent service! I've eaten here probably 10 times over the years and I've never been disappointed. For a high end restaurant, the menu is quite diverse, ensuring that all diners will have a number of great selections from which to choose. The timing of dishes' arrival is smooth and well paced; not rushed nor do you wait for long stretches of time. Specialty cocktails are fun and delicious, and ice tea, coffee, etc, are regularly refreshed without prompting. It's also nice that all of the pastas, with just one exception, are offered in half size portions, if you care to order as an appetizer or side dish. All in all, a great choice for fine dining in Washington, DC!",5,0,0,0
"Dauglas F.","3/6/2019","Washington, DC","I literally just left the restaurant hungry with a $ 155 check. Here's my review on this dinning experience. Wine- we asked for recommendations for bubbly and white, our sommelier fuddled the wine list at least a dozen of pages before she was able to say anything. Apparently she didn't know what she was doing. Then I asked for glass of bubbly, I asked her what was the cepage of Conard Duchene, she goes its Pinot Nior and Pinot Grigio, which was incorrect. If you'd like to be a sommelier, please know your menu and your wine profiles at least.Food- I was really excited to try this place out as a friend recommended it. But guess what, my pasta came out under cooked, the irony was our waitress said we're known for our pasta. Probably known for your undercooked pasta ?!Service - considering the price point here, I'd assume the service should be way above the par. But it's not. Nobody bothered to check on us. I had to place my under cooked pasta aside hoping to grab our waitress's attention. It sat there at least 5 min before anybody noticed. And it's the manager not our waitress. Then I explicitly requested our check several time, but she insisted I should wait on her free desserts. That's really unnecessary coz you're wasting my time. I really hope I could have said something favorable, but there wasn't any. I'm not coming back.",1,4,0,0
"Sarah C.","3/10/2019","Dallas, TX","Scrolling through Yelp looking for a dinner spot and the photos of the food here caught my eye. I peeped their menu and saw the bottomless brunch for $65 and instantly sold. Since I'm from out of town I figured it would be a good spot to meet up with my friends. The food was incredible. The eggplant.. amazing. I don't even like eggplant. The flatbread was also great and the mussels.. they were mussels. Good but not to die for. For entrees I got the French toast and my friends got the lobster rolls and calamari.  If I had to stack rank them, and I think my friends would agree with this, it would be French toast, lobster rolls then calamari. The calamari was good, but not really good for brunch. In terms of the service, it was amazing at first but as it got busier it progressively got worse. My biggest pet peeve in the world is when servers don't clean up your dishes. We had been done eating for easily 30 minutes before we finally waved someone down to clean it up. The smell of the calamari just sitting there was the worst. The young girl with the braces that was bringing out mimosas was great and definitely on top of it. Overall, 5 stars because the food was great and I'd guess that our experience with the service isn't normally like that.",5,0,0,0
"Anjali K.","3/11/2019","Bethesda, MD","Have been here several times but the most recent dinner on a Saturday night was very disappointing. Both the service and the food seems to have declined. We were waiting at the bar for a good 20 minutes for our drinks. After reminding the (3) bartenders there, one of them finally served us the drinks, but then it was time to get seated for dinner. The Adriatic seafood platter was very average and, for 2 people, insufficient. There was 1 (maybe?) 4 oz filet of fish, 1 lobster claw, 1 small lobster tail and 1 small langoustine. For $65. Barely sufficient for 1 person and definitely not for 2. We had also ordered 2 appetizers - eggplant and oysters which were good but not exceptional. Dessert was the waiter's recommendation of a torta that was basically cream upon cream upon cream. $350 for dinner for 2 with a half bottle of wine. We basically filled up on the bread. Not worth it. We will not be back.",3,1,0,0

My wife got the burrata, Fiola Mare Breakfast and the tiramisu. Everything is was excellent! We didn't know but we also ordered a drink from their signature cocktail menu which was not included in the brunch.  We got the Bellagio and the foreign policy.

"Stephanie T.","4/6/2019","Capitol Hill, Washington, DC","Hostesses were kind. The long wait time to order while the server was constantly preoccupied is not the level of service we expected from this place. For some odd reason our drinks came out in a reasonable time. I had to finally flag down a waiter to place an order. Since the lack of poor customer service, we stuck with one dish to share because we were thinking of eating elsewhere unless customer service improved. I ordered the lobster ravioli and the waiter ensured us there was enough for two people. What a lie! The small portion size for lobster ravioli at $60 is extremely disappointing and was not enough for two people. The lobster was chewy and three tiny raviolis was laughable. Due to lack of customer service and the lie told, we decided to eat somewhere else. I really had high hopes for this place. Plus, appetizers on the menu was lacking, no variety, as well as non seafood dishes.",2,2,0,0
"Alarm C.","4/7/2019","Houghton, NY","I was at the restaurant with my mother, experience was ok. My mom wasn't impressed though bc she had to ask one of the servers four times to get a hot cup of coffee with her meal, altho the server was kind enough to grab a drink menu for me with full list of cocktails. I enjoyed the complimentary ceviche sample, and the desserts (that were clearly store bought). The oysters were tasty, the pasta dish was fine. The reason it was only fine is because the pasta itself was not cooked all the way through and there was sand in my dish I could feel when I slurped down the sauce. If treated right, and if the clams were truly fresh, there shouldn't be any sand left in the clams. The sauce in the GRAGNANO SPAGUETTI ALLA CHITARRA was very good, not greasy at all, plenty if ither clam meat in it which I liked.

"Andrew H.","4/18/2019","Washington, DC","Yep...Fiola Mare is good. After having done a few brunches, an anniversary dinner, and now a lunch at this Georgetown Waterfront restaurant, I now feel qualified to give Fiola Mare the official stamp of approval.I've now had the pleasure of trying a number of dishes over my visits and I can honestly say that there hasn't been a bad bite. The Brook Trout over leeks I had at lunch this past week was particularly good, though it may have been overshadowed by the Walleye Pike that came in the 3-course Maria Menu (great deal at only $26!!). Unfortunately, I didn't get to sample the crab cake or paccheri that my family ordered; though by the practically clean plates we left after eating, I imagine we all enjoyed our meals.If anything, I'd say that while the tuna tartare is good, I'd prefer the ratio to be a lot more tuna than avocado and tomato. Also the seafood tower is always a hit for a group, I don't know if it's a must. And lastly, while the famed lobster ravioli is delicious and the seafood broth that comes with is amazing, I don't know if it has to be a must try.There are a lot of restaurants here in DC where you know you're going to leave satiated and satisfied...Fiola Mare is right there on top of the list.",4,0,0,2

In the end, it is a ""bar"" and some customers will be louder than others during happy hour. I am talking about a bit loud and speaking a foreign language, and not rowdy by any means. It doesn't mean that you will make the entire party feel unwelcome and don't give them the service that they deserve. Because of this bar service, I actually went ahead and cancelled the table that we were waiting for. I am not sure if the restaurant service would have been the same.

"Nicki L.","5/28/2019","Westwood, NJ","We chose this quaint restaurant for Sunday brunch this past Memorial Day weekend due to its location on the banks of the Potomac River, next to Waterfront Park. What a beautiful area.We arrived early for an 11 o'clock reservation and were graciously allowed inside to wait despite the restaurant not yet being open because of the heat and humidity (85 degrees).We ordered some drinks to start. My Villa Carlotta pictured here, was a mix of gin, hibiscus, cucumber and lime and was very refreshing on this warm, muggy morning. Served in a cute fish glass and pleasantly oversized. My health-conscious daughter ordered the Organic Green Delight, a healthy green juice consisting of cucumber, kale, apple and spinach.For lunch we ordered the 1/2 chilled Maine lobster and two salads, one with arugula and one with mixed greens called Colors of the Garden. Both were adorned with pretty (and edible) flowers, the presentation was impeccable. The Maine lobster was also delicious but we were slightly disappointed at the small serving size. For the main course, we had the Jumbo Lump Crab Benedict and the Sardinian Ricotta Cavatelli. Both were decent portions and delicious. Perhaps it was too early in the morning, or maybe it was just the heat, but the cavatelli was very filling and we could not finish it. Despite the heat, we really wanted to sit outside so we sat at the upper balcony (versus ground level to the waterfront) and the umbrellas were well situated to protect us from the sun. Unfortunately, I did get some mosquito bites (I was the only one from my group) but I want to especially thank our server who was gracious enough to bring me some anti-bite cream so that I could enjoy the rest of the brunch.Overall dining experience was wonderful and I would certainly visit this establishment again!",4,1,0,0

"Cynthia J.","7/19/2019","Tysons, VA","I called them an ""Oldie BUT Goodie."" Does Fiola Mare actually need a review? Fiola Mare never disappoints. Every dish on the menu is exceptional and even the bar service supersedes. I usually go during lunch time when Tom the bartender is there. I come here for ""one thing and one thing only!""...The Lobster Ravioli. I visited many restaurants all over and no one can top or exceed Fiola Mare's dish. They are rated highly for a reason.",5,6,1,4
"Christopher T.","7/25/2019","Washington, DC","We dined earlier this year for Valentine's Day  and had an amazing experience. We decided that we'd love to go back for my wife's birthday. I made the reservation online but forgot to put that detail in the notes. I called an hour before our reservation to ask if they could notate that for our server. The young lady on the phone said ""No problem!"" I then asked about the corkage fee. I was told ""It's $35 per bottle with a two bottle limit and the bottle of wine cannot be one that's served here at the restaurant."" I then asked if she could check if the wine I wanted to bring was on their list. I gave her the details and she said it wasn't on their list. We got to the restaurant and had a great experience. I really wish I remembered our server's name because he was REALLY good. The problem arose when we received our bill and there was a $50 corkage fee. I mentioned this to the server who then went to tell his manager. The manager returned to our table and asked if I remembered who I spoke with on the phone. I told him I didn't ask for her name but I gave him the details of the call I had with the young lady as well as showed him the time I called on my call log in my phone. He then proceeds to tell me that ""everyone there knows the corkage fee is $50"" and ""if that's what you want to pay then you can pay it"" as if I came there to spend almost $300 on a dinner only to argue with him about $15! I have much better things to do than that. This left me feeling very disappointed and sad that we even went to this restaurant. It's not my fault I was told that. The business I own is based in customer service. If I had a customer come in with this situation I wouldn't have gone past do you remember who you spoke with. Even if they didn't remember or didn't ask I would have adjusted the bill and at closing I would have reiterated to the staff the price of our corkage fee and wine policies. When you decide to dine at an establishment like this you are going for not only the food but also for the experience. I'll take my money elsewhere next time.",1,0,0,0
"Halah A.","7/27/2019","Arlington, VA","Been wanting to try Fiola Mare for so long and I finally did. Went for brunch and I loved it! The eggplant with garlic and molasses was phenomenal I'm a huge fan of eggplants and this was something else! must try it. The tuna tartare was great as well. The crab Benedict is by far one of the best I've had! The lobster roll however I did not care much for, I'm not a big fan of lobster rolls in general but everything else was delicious. Enjoyed the service too our waiter was very nice. Would definitely go back for dinner.",5,0,0,0

"Cydnee R.","8/6/2019","New York, NY","If it's round down or round up, it's five stars for Fiola Mare. It was a special occasion, and I think we might have preferred Fiola, but my husband has celiac disease and Mare was much clearer about accommodating gluten allergies, so that's where we went. It feels a little old fashioned (very mature, traditional DC crowd) but there's nothing wrong with a classic. It was a Monday night visit, and service was languid, but we were in no rush. Our server, Mirian, was wonderful, walking us through every stage of our dining experience and providing dedicated service. At one point midway through our meal I mentioned that I liked the style of their new banquettes, and she offered to move us immediately. (We stayed, but that was just one example of their ""above and beyond"" attitude.) We did ask to speak to the sommelier, but he truly didn't feel confident or eager to make recommendations, so we chose a bottle in our own and ordered a few cocktails as well - the Rye Can't We Be Friends was ""a real proper Manhattan,"" per my husband's high standards, and I ordered the gin and tonic, with house made tonic and infused gin, it was outstanding. Half a dozen oysters - really great. Virginia oysters were outstanding but the Mystic CT oysters were the best. Pasta course - Mirian recommended the strezzapretti, which I adored - the king crab and corn were a perfect balance. My husband had a gluten free fusilli with the tomato and basil sauce, and wished he'd ordered a full portion. Main course - husband had the merluzzo. He's not the biggest fan of poached fish but cleaned his plate. I ordered the Arctic char, which was a little fatty, but delicious. The salsa verde served on the side is worthy of being bottled, and the cucumber and pickled onion salad served with the fish was one of the best parts of the meal. Dessert - we were celebrating several special occasions, and Fiola Mare was very generous in celebrating with us. We ordered the chocolate cake (flourless and gluten free) and tiramisu, and Mirian also brought us a selection of other desserts, including a lemon cake, lemon sorbet, and house-made jelly candies. To be honest - some of the desserts were a bit over the top. The sorbet was insanely sweet, and the tiramisu, while delicious and decadent and clearly a mainstay, probably didn't need the chocolate gelato. The jellies were a thoughtful gesture because they were gluten free, but excessively sweet. Thanks for a great, memorable night, Fiola Mare!",5,2,0,2
"Christina L.","8/9/2019","Arlington, VA","This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion, and is great if you like seafood. It is on the pricey side but if you're looking for a fancier place or a splurge, it's a good choice. With one drink per person, an appetizer and a few dishes, you will likely spend around $60-80 per person without tip and tax. My husband and I came here to celebrate our birthday and had a really nice evening out. While it is a more upscale restaurant that caters more towards adults than lots of families, I did see one or two families sitting outside in the patio area with children.The restaurant is huge so you won't feel like you're sitting on top of another table. The kitchen is also really big and open, which is nice since you can see many of the dishes being prepared. They start you off with some complimentary bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar and I could have eaten a whole loaf of this, it was so good.The menu has a good variety and changes frequently (since the date is printed each day - always a good sign). They have some appetizers like tuna tartare, ceviche, some vegetables, sides, cooked fish with sauces, and grilled fish, and pasta.Since I can't have dairy or egg, we couldn't eat most of the menu, but what we did have was delicious.YELLOWFIN TUNA CARPACCIO ($22) - San Marzano Tomato Water, Sorrel, Yuzu, Olives, Capers, Smoked Trout Roe - We wanted to get ceviche, but they were out. I didn't really care for this carpaccio - there was too much stuff/sauces on it, so you couldn't even taste the fish. I liked the smoke trout roe on the top of it, but generally with fresh fish, less is more and this had too much going on.EGGPLANT AL FUNGHETTO ($18) - Japanese Eggplant Glazed in Black Garlic Molasses Pomodorini, Roasted Garlic Aioli. This was one of the best dishes we had all night, the eggplant was just the right amount of sweetness and it had a lot of sauce but it was delicious. I could have eaten 3 of these myself. It's a bit expensive for eggplant, but it's definitely one of the better eggplant dishes I've had and I would absolutely get this again.ADRIATIC MIXED GRILLED SEAFOOD 13 OZ (SERVES 1) ($65) - This was one of the few things that I could eat that wasn't cooked with butter - just olive oil, but it was so good and you could really taste and appreciate the freshness of the seafood. There was fish, shrimp, lobster, and calamari and it was all delicious.My husband got the half portion of the cacio & pepe (which was more than half the price of the regular dish, but half the amount) and he said it was good, but not quite as good as the ones we had in Rome, which I guess was to be expected. But when you pay $14 for a half portion, it seems like a lot.Overall, we had a really nice dining experience here and the seafood is definitely fresh and prepared well. Stick with the dishes that don't have as many sauces or things added to it, so that you can really enjoy the seafood. We'd come back here for a special occasion, or this would be a great business dinner that you can expense.",4,2,1,3
"Richard T.","8/12/2019","Bethesda, MD","On a summer Saturday, given the choice of sitting in the swelter of a sultry night within too-easy earshot of the teeming hormonal masses of twenty and thirty somethings out for a weekend toot and a deafening, but air-conditioned, dining room, we opted for the former. Probably a mistake, but at least we could usually hear each other.As the only non-piscivore of the group, I had NO options for entrée in spite of a mouth-watering number of offerings on the online menu. The only entrée option for the meat eater this particular night  was a veal shank FOR TWO. A companion agreed to forgo the fish dish he had hoped to order to accommodate me when the restaurant couldn't. We both left most of the greasy, tasteless, and unpleasantly textured dish on our plates. Nuff said.The wine list is as overpriced as any I can remember seeing, with mediocre Italian vintages at at least four to five times retail. Even the reds by the glass averaged close to $100 a glass and we're not talking Romanée-Conti here. Yes, the fish eaters to a man enjoyed their meal, but they shared my astonishment at the incongruity of such an aspirational restaurant being noisily nestled such a bustling venue. Even NYC doesn't do fine dining at street level in Times Square.We won't be back, and not just because I don't eat fish.",2,2,2,1
"Michael J.","8/18/2019","Brooklyn, NY","It's our go-to restaurant when we are in DC! Before i even say anything, I want to warn about pricing. I frequently see reviews that are grated wrongfully because of the check being high. I feel like that's one of the only and the main flaw of Yelp. Prices are listed on the menu, when you pick a restaurant pls make sure you are ok with the costs and don't review it 3-star if the bill was too high and then go on about great decor, service and food. So, prices here are not cheap. Pls be prepared... but it's worth it!The menu changes all the time, I actually think they change it every day. We come from New York 4-5 times a year and we come here for dinner every trip. Here are some highlights of must-try:The Seafood mix grill is really good. it includes calamari, lobster, salmon and some other fish ;-) all grilled to perfection and tastes deliciousI don't eat meat but but family says that their Prime Rib is the best they ever had!Grilled calamari tastes like it would in Greece or Spain, it's 10/10Pasta with red shrimp and sea urchin is something I get every single time as it's to die for.

Overall the prices were expected but the food did not match said prices. When we go to a nice restaurant, there are certain expectations to be met. I'm not one of those reviewers that leaves a resturant mad because of prices, because I fully believe you know what you are getting into when going. That said, the food quality wasn't worth it. My pasta was undercooked and even the bread they delivered was cold and with plain oil. My boyfriend did enjoy his seafood plate so maybe I ordered the wrong thing? While the food and the prices did not match, the service was great. At the end of the day I think it's one of those restaurants that people go to just to say they went to it.

Our next course was the pasta: again way too salty and a cream sauce that had too much clove. The main course was good.

Parking was a cinch as there what's a valet available. Valet was a little bit expensive but it is Georgetown and I have experienced worse. We enter the restaurant. What a beautiful scene in the patio. There was an outdoor fireplace / coffee table. We entere the lobby and were greeted by the hostess. Checked my coat and were ushered to our table. I had mentioned on the reservation that it was my fiance's birthday. She was given a special menu. Happy birthday was written on the top of her menu. There were many special small gifts given to my fiance that evening. It made the whole experience absolutely incredible. Truly, I see the value now of small favors . The meal was absolutely incredible. We had the Branzino we had a lobster ravioli. Which they seem to be famous for preparing. The risotto was excellent as well. And I have to say this. The graffiti eggplant was truly awe-inspiring. I could not get enough of it. If the meal ended there I would have given them five stars for the just that alone. Fernando our host and server was excellent. Honestly, I am not a rich man. I will not be able to go on a daily basis. And I probably would if I could. It is something that everyone should experience.

"Bill B.","2/3/2020","College Park, MD","Anniversary dinner. Got a glass of sparkling wine gratis at the beginning of the meal, which was quite nice. Wife got a special cocktail recommended by the waiter. Too sweet and just not very interesting. I got a $20 glass of chardonnay and another later in the meal; wife got the same after giving up on the insipid cocktail. Got the ""MISHIMA A5 WAGYU TARTARE,"" which was a little tough and lacked much taste. Might have liked it better if I didn't know the price. Also got the ""COLORS OF THE GARDEN"" salad, which was really wet with the ""Truffle Vinaigrette"" dressing. Wife got the ""BURRATA,"" which we also didn't finish for lack of flavor. On the waiter's suggestion I got the ""SEA SCALLOPS,"" a $48 dish with some 6 scallops, 2 of which were hard and rubbery. My wife got a steelhead trout dish, which isn't on the web menu. I think she quite liked that. For dessert my wife got ""CHOCOLATE MARCHESI"" (I'm copying dish names from the web version of the menu; note the quote marks on the last item were actually in the web menu for some reason). She ate perhaps half as she doesn't care for pistachios and the kitchen failed to remove them as instructed. The waiter comp'd that when she realized and gave us some pleasant chocolates gratis. I got the ""FIOLA MARE TIRAMISU,"" which was a not very tasty ice-cream-cake version of tiramisu.I should say the service seemed rather good for a busy Friday night and the owners (or managers who acted very much like the owners) stopped by our table a couple times it seemed. Maybe if we had ordered pasta we would feel differently. I'll review this with my wife and see if the rating should be changed but I feel good with it right now.I used ""waiter"" above despite the fact it was a woman who served us because I think that is proper usage.

If there was an option for negative stars, I would have chosen that!  I usually don't write bad reviews but this place deserves one. I called on Monday early afternoon to ask for a reservation for Valentine's day between 6:30 and 7PM. They put me on the waiting list and then on Tuesday evening, they called and said I got a reservation for 6:45, which sounded great and I thought ""awesome!"" They wanted my credit card information to secure my reservation, but I was in the middle of a meeting with a client so I told them I would call back right away. They told me they would give me 10-15 minutes to secure it. I called back within 3 minutes to have one of my staff provide the information, but they said the reservation was already given away. My staff member was put on hold and then hung up on. I called them back and they didn't answer so my staff member called back on a different phone and they answered without hesitation. They were rude and after realizing I was unhappy, they offered me a spot at the bar at 8:30. That was unacceptable because it was not within the time frame I was looking for, and it was a spot at the bar, not a table. Whoever is reading this, please spend your money somewhere else. I didn't get the chance to try their food, but based on what I've heard it is good.

We arrived for my wife's birthday with our 4 month old along for the ride. While we were initially nervous about being at such a nice restaurant with a little one, the restaurant staff was extremely welcoming, got smiles from her, and were very accommodating by seating us in a quiet corner. Despite a fairly full restaurant, the staff continued to check on us and make sure that we were comfortable. Miguel, our waiter, was one of the best waiters we ever had and really made the experience! He was friendly, kept us laughing, and made us feel welcome. Miguel alone, will keep us coming back! He provided some excellent recommendations too. For around $80 you cannot go wrong with the 3 course bottomless champagne brunch (unlimited bellinis, mimosas, and bubbles for two hours) and very tasty food options. While we were hesitant to order french toast, Miguel did not lead us astray with that recommendation. This was the best french toast that we have ever had (my wife had dreams about it, no lie)! The ricotta donuts are a must (save some room). The staff added a nice personal touch by signing a card for my wife and providing a complimentary cake.While it was 30 degrees outside, the staff and experience was full of warmth. We are looking forward to coming back on a nice spring day for some outdoor seating and the beautiful view (and hopefully Miguel as our waiter)! Thank you Fiola Mare for the experience!",5,1,0,0

"Maggie W.","3/10/2020","Olney, MD","This was my first time coming to Fiola Mare, my friend and I decided to celebrate our birthdays there because we heard how amazing the food is. However nobody mentioned how horrible the dining experience was going to be. I am not one that normally complains but for how much money you're paying I feel the quality of the experience is just as important as the food itself. It was a Saturday night so obviously the restaurant was busy, we were seated an hour after our original reservation time. When we were seated, they sat us at a table that was not large enough for our party of five. Then we proceeded to wait 15 min for just bread and water. My friend and I decided to order their specialty drink ""trouble maker"", and oh the kind of trouble this drink caused the staff. It took 20 minutes to get this drink. While we were waiting for it, our server came over and explained they were out of the pineapple cup, which is what the drink is presented in. He asked if we'd mind having it in a regular glass or wait a few more minutes for the pineapple cup to be washed and served to us. I thought after that, the restaurant would feel like they should comp at least the drink off of our check. Instead the manager/owner came over I believe to check on us. There was no apology for the wait, and nothing was comped off our check. I think because we were such happy easy going bunch and did not want to cause a scene they didn't feel the need to acknowledge their wrong doing. Fiola mare was very disappointing.",2,0,0,0
"Han L.","3/21/2020","Atlanta, GA","Utterly impressed with the food and service here. I made OpenTable reservations for my fiance's birthday and they were very mindful of it from when we first greeted the hostess to the end of our meal. The location is situated on a waterfront and would have been nice to walk around had we had more time. The ambience is elegant, warm, and inviting. Our server greeted us with complimentary celebratory champagne for my fiance's birthday.  It was good quality champagne too, lol. Wow what a great start to the evening. There were unexpected changes to our schedule so we arrived with a fuller stomach than we planned sadly. We ended up deciding on the seafood appetizer for two. It was DECKED OUT with all of our favorite goodies from the sea: oysters, sea urchin, prawns, lobsters, mussels, scallops. It was sooo fresh! Moreover, you can tell they were very attentive to the presentation as well. Although we only opted to share that dish, we were treated with this amazing lobster pasta dish on the house. What the hell? Why are they so awesome and why was it so delicious? Our server also offered to refill our bread basket with new fresh, warm bread to eat with the pasta. Finally, he presented my fiance with a lemon custard dessert and a birthday card. Man, I get that a lot of restaurants offer this for guests on their special occasion. However, I have to say, this place really have gone above and beyond. Our server was so knowledgeable, friendly, professional, and attentive. Like literally the epitome of great service. I wish I could remember his name to give him the shout-out he deserves. I highly recommend this place and plan to come back to try their other menu options.",5,13,6,16

Apparently they are able to set up a time dor the pick-up, but not for the delivery. That is not clearly outlined on their website.

"Brendon D.","4/16/2020","Denver, CO","I live in Denver, and make it a point to go to Fiola Mare multiple times per year. Whenever anyone asks me what the best restaurant is, I tell them Fiola Mare out in Washington D.C. There are other places, in New York, Boston, San Fran and other cities with food that is almost just as good, but Fiola pulls ahead of all of them because their waitstaff is world class. The absolute best. They're always a pleasure to interact with and know their stuff. Their sommeliers always hit the nail on the head both with their suggestions and for identifying a wine based on some criteria. Sometimes I am rather vague without trying to be, but the sommeliers always get me. Their cocktails are also excellent. When you come, don't hold back. That's not the way to enjoy Fiola Mare. Eat a full meal and get the things you really want, including desert. I go to DC a lot on business, and when I first bought my wife along and took her to Fiola Mare she bought it up every time we went out to eat for almost a year and is excited to go again.

"Marion B.","7/23/2020","Bethesda, MD","Fiola Mare was the first restaurant my husband and I went to in 4 months, after the DC area began to open up in early June and Covid cases were steadily decreasing. We've been there many times, and we trusted the impeccable service/staff enough to believe they would adhere to all precautions. They did. We had a table outside for brunch on a beautiful, cloudless Sunday. The staff was fantastic, as were the cocktails and food. Oysters on the half shell with a lemony, herby sauce. Caesar to make you swoon. Lobster ravioli (no need to say more). Octopus a la plancha with salsa verde. Sublime, and enough for our lunch the next day. We were going to go back for my birthday in late July. However, with the rise in Covid cases in the DC/MD/VA area, we decided instead to order their seafood pot, which you cook on the stovetop at home. Lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, snow crab, potatoes, corn on the cob, andouille sausage, a spice packet, and two sauces (a spicy aioli type sauce and cocktail sauce). It was fabulous.

"Roger M.","7/29/2020","Arlington, VA","Parking: Parking is available in near-by garages but an uber will probably cost about the same.(depending of how far you are traveling of course). Service: one- star for service. I was extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. Waited over an hour to get seated even though I made a reservation a week in advance. The point of a reservation is to avoid wait time. A reservation is suppose to guaranteed  that a  table will be available for that specific requested date/time. In addition, there is a $100 charge if you decide to cancel the reservation within 48 hours just like you would when reserving a hotel room. What is the point of a reservation is you have to wait this long then?  How come customers are charged  for cancelling a reservation yet there is no accountability on their end? can I charge them for not  keeping the end of their bargain?  of-course not.Food/Drinks: Two stars. the food and cocktails were decent, a bit overpriced in my opinion  but I guess customers pay  for the ambiance rather than the food. The ambiance is nice, and noise level  what you would expect in restaurant but by the time I was seated I was upset that I hardly enjoyed my time. Overpriced in my opinion. I also want to mention  that there is an additional fee of  4%  added to your final bill. They claim the additional fee is to help maintain proper hygiene and provide supplies to their employees during the pandemic. Although I understand that restaurants are suffering right know, and I appreciate the fact that they are doing their best to keep the everyone safe,  I truly doubt this fee will be temporary. I guaranteed this will become permanent.",3,4,2,2

Also many drinks and those were top notch too. The patio was fantastic and we never had to struggle to have conversation and enjoy catching up due to volume or crowding like pre-COVID times. I really have to crave seafood to eat it but I am pretty sure I could eat here every single day if budget and distance permitted. I would literally sleep in a bed of these oysters and I didn't even like oysters before but I stubbornly was made to try some. I'm glad I relented!

"Hal R.","8/11/2020","New York, NY","Fiola Mare deserves their Michelin star. It is without a doubt some of the best seafood in Washington and their changing menu delivers a host of different flavors. Their portions are larger than most Michelin restaurants. I was only disappointed in the quality of the service. Though the food and ambiance are certainly of Michelin quality, the service was at times slow and lacking in the detail that one would usually expect. Eggplant al Funghetto (5/5): This was my appetizer and favorite dish of the evening. It can only be described as an eggplant dish that tastes like butter. It was sweet and tender and dissolved in my mouth with each bite. The sauce that came with it added great flavors as well. Farro Tagliatelle (4/5): This pasta dish was wonderful but a little smaller than I would have liked to see for the price. Their Ragu was so flavorful and the sugar plums gave the dish a great balance of sweetness and tartness. If you are looking for something besides seafood, I would recommend the tagliatelle. Whole Mediterranean Branzino (5/5): Their branzino was perfect. It was deboned table side and the waiter did an excellent job. It was light, salty, and flakey, just as one would hope. If you are looking for a classic and simple but delicious white fish option, the branzino is a great choice. It is basic but incredibly delicious and filling. Despite some lapses in service, I had a great experience at Fiola Mare. I don't think Fiola Mare can rival the experience of their sister restaurant, Fiola, but it is nonetheless a great restaurant for great seafood. Their location in the Georgetown waterfront is modern, chic, and simple. I love the natural lightning, nautical theme, and open concept. If you are looking for quality seafood and Italian for a special occasion, Fiola Mare is a good option that will please any pallet.",5,1,0,1
"Karolina M.","8/18/2020","Warren, NJ","The night before we dined at Del Mar, which as always was amazing. So we decided and assumed Fiola Mare being the step up sister restaurant will have more to offer. Sadly, this was not the case. Although the restaurant itself was nice and the service was good, the food just didn't deliver for us. Although fresh ingredients, the flavors were on the more mild side. The seafood tower was definitely a great choice for quite the price tag, but worth it in comparison to the other dishes. Without a single doubt, I will say the desserts were incredible. The chocolate cake was to die for and im not a sweets kind of gal. That being said, I would return for a cocktail and dessert, but that is unfortunately, about it.",3,9,3,4

"Rebecca B.","8/25/2020","Chantilly, VA","This place has gone so far down hill. Besides being a miserable experience during Covid, the food was a 5 at best. I had the Halibut with mushrooms and it was so salty I could hardly eat it. It was also cold because I had to wait 20 minutes for the bathroom. They will only let one person in at a time, but they have no problem letting anyone walking by from the waterfront come on in.  My friend got the scallops - also a 5/10 and for $50 you would think you would get more than 4 quarter sized scallops with two raw radishes, 3 basil leaves, and a sprinkle of other bits of raw vegetables. It would've been hilarious if we hadn't spent $250 (for 2 people) on a miserable experience. The waiter had to be begged to bring us more water multiple times and served us over the back of our booth TWICE - I'm not kidding! We were seated at a kind of circular table and he brought us bread (had to ask for it) and a dessert over the back of the booth. Insane.  This used to be a favorite but after this, I'll never go back.",1,0,0,0
"Mya N.","9/1/2020","Washington, DC","This review is solely just for their customer service. I have never had such difficult time trying to call a restaurant over the phone. I gave up today and wrote to them instead. They did reply and confirmed my reservation. However, they were not able to guarantee my request in my reservation for outdoor table because all their tables were on a first come first serve basis. I explained to them that I understand this is the policy for NORMAL times, but I would need this seating information due to current COVID circumstances. This would be my first time dining out (after what like 6 months!!!!!?) and I said I specifically chose their place because we were only comfortable with outdoor dining and safety measures plus to celebrate a big 30th birthday (this is not the day to be in disappointment). I WAS READY TO SPLURGE THERE. And guess what the reply was? They said they understand my concerns but that ""basically there is no difference in risk for indoor vs. outdoor dining"" with the link from CDC. Um...why would restaurants expand on the roadside to accommodate outdoor tables then???? And seriously, even if they have good ventilation measures for indoor dining, so what we're not comfortable doing that?? We are in strange circumstances these days and we need to respect each other's level of comfort. A great customer service would NOT try to suggest indoor dining, but find ways on how they can accommodate concerned customers (offering to check earlier time options for example???).  I guess I expected great service from a $$$$ restaurant. I replied to cancel my reservation (they have a $50 fee for each person) and they never responded. So I ended up calling the restaurant again (it worked this time) and finally cancelled it. I was really looking forward to celebrating here but with all these red flags, it's just safer to pick another place.",2,5,0,0

"Andrew M.","9/6/2020","Washington, DC","We have eaten wonderful meals at fiola mare and Del Mar in the past (an anniversary meal at Del Mar just before Covid was particularly memorable). But our recent visit to Fiola Mare was a dumpster fire. In brief:- we showed a few minutes early for our 8:45 reservation and are told they were just seating 8 pm. (We ended up getting our appetizer at 10:10.)- we were told we couldn't get a drink while we were waiting, so we took a walk and returned to see multiple people standing around having drinks. (It took us another 15 minutes talking to multiple staff, but we did get a drink that we paid for.)- we specifically asked to sit outside and they ended up putting us inside (this is when we should have left).- after we ordered, the waitress came back and told us they were out of 2 dishes. They were suddenly out of two more dishes we tried to order. (Including the lobster ravioli, which is why we went there in the first place.)-the bread came over 20 min after we had ordered and then the olive oil a few minutes after that.- what saved the meal was the waitress asking the chef to make us a lobster pasta that was not on the menu; not as good as the ravioli but delicious. The waitress was very professional and she was probably put in the front line tending to the fire.- brought our side potato dish when we were finishing our meal. It wasn't the dish on the menu and they said they wouldn't charge us but they did. It was pretty tasteless too.Too much chaos for us to enjoy ourselves on what was supposed to be a special night.",1,1,0,0

It really put my mind at ease to see the staff constantly sanitizing and cleaning; the restaurant itself was spacious, allowing an appropriate amount of distance between tables. And despite the tremendous amount of extra effort to keep us safe from any virus, once seated, this restaurant was also able to provide a much desired feeling of normalcy with its wonderful dining environment.Onto the food- the seafood tower we ordered was amazing. The shrimp, oysters, alaskan crab legs, etc were exceptionally fresh. I also ordered the lobster ravioli which was so creamy and flavorful, and came along with perfectly cooked lobster tail (10/10 would visit DC again just for that dish). With our dessert, we shared a slice of chocolate cake which was absolutely heavenly. not too sweet or rich- the actual cake itself was crunchy with the familiar taste of bits of Ferrero rocher. The great thing is that I cannot even say which dish was the star of the show. Every single plate we ordered was spectacular and I cannot wait to visit again!",5,0,0,0

"Gloria R.","9/29/2020","Bethesda, MD","BEST BIRTHDAY LUNCH -  EVER!!Ok so my lame ass is finally getting around to posting this fantastic review for this even more fantastic restaurant.  Let's take a walk down memory lane shall we? My hubby and I went to Fiola Mare on Friday Sept 4th to celebrate my upcoming 50th birthday (brought the reading glasses for the menu ya'll! Growing old sucks!) We were promptly greeted, seated and met our super sweet, handsome Italian waiter (can't remember his name but he's dreamy- uh, just like my hubby!! Gotta give the hubby props or there will be no more birthday lunches!)  We ordered our cocktails and an appetizer of the Wild Rhode Island Calamari! How can you go wrong with 1 lbs of delicious, grilled, melt in your mouth, perfectly seasoned calamari?? I really shouldn't eat ""a pound"" of anything, but it was to die for. So a small snafu launched our lunch- as one of the servers brought over our drinks, she reached over me to service my husband's drink and promptly dropped both cocktails on her platter all over me. Glass and frozen sangria everywhere, but somehow miraculously my white shorts didn't even get a splash! The entire wait staff and director, Stefania Sorrenti, came over and took great care of us, moved us, gave me a bandaid (for barely a nick), brought new drinks and rest of the lunch went off without even the slightest hiccough! But here's where the story gets good. We had just snarfed down the calamari and finished it off with our drinks - Venetian Spritz for hubby and Spritz in Milano for me- delicious! I had just turned to my husband as they took away our plates and glasses and said ""that was a strong drink- I think I'm just going to have tea for the rest of lunch"" and lo and behold Stefania brings over two more drinks and says ""on the house!"" THAT is so super classy and cool! She's as gorgeous as she is kind! Our first course comes- me with Burrata (nitro pesto! So cool! It's like a delicious dry ice science project!) and Tuna Confit salad for hubby. Next it's our entrees of rigatoni for hubby and amazing Branzino in a delicate saffron broth for me. But then they bring out an extra entree of the squid ink fusilli for us to try! And it was FANTABULOUS!!! With pieces of octopus and calamari- perfectly seasoned, not overwhelmingly inky! We cried ""uncle!"" So much food! I felt like the big guy at the end of Monty Pythons's the ""Meaning of Life"" who is offered ""one more after dinner mint?""  Our waiter laughed and said his grandmother must be in the kitchen making all this food! Ok- now dessert.  I'm telling you people, just like going to a warm, welcoming and friendly Italian family's house for a meal, Fiola Mare made sure we were supremely well fed and had plenty to drink.  We had both ordered the goat cheese and vanilla custard- it was so light with refreshing shaved ice and chilled peaches. Stunning dessert. But then they brought out a campfire sundae which had the most amazing marshmallow gelato I've ever had! AND a birthday cake and ""happy birthday"" note from Chef Fabio Trabocchi!! I felt like I had died and gone to food heaven. Our waiter floated down with wings and laughed at my husband and I who were literally in a food coma at this point.  Literally I can't remember ever having a more special, attentive, glorious meal in my whole life, let alone in a culinary powerhouse like Fiola Mare. The chef, the director, the staff, our waiter, everyone was top notch. The food, the drinks, the desserts could each have been the standout showpiece in this meal but every single offering was fantastic and better than anything I have ever tasted. This place was amazing and I hope they remain the fine dining bedrock of Georgetown!",5,0,0,0

"Cori T.","10/3/2020","South Riding, VA","I would rate the food as 3.5 stars & the service as 5 stars.Made a reservation for my anniversary dinner here. The service was OUTSTANDING. One of the best we've experienced. Each person we encountered from the moment we walked in wished us happy anniversary (about 4-5 people) which made us feel so special. Our server was the sweetest, knowledgeable Italian man.Firstly, the foccacia bread came out & it was SO salty. Our meal started out strong with our 1st appetizer. For apps, we ordered the bigeye tuna & burrata. The tuna was delicious - it was so buttery. Paired perfectly with the yuzu cream & overall a perfect balance of texture & flavors. The burrata was not our favorite, but it was definitely interesting. I prefer to have burrata at room temp or slightly warm. This burrata is quite cold because of the nitro pesto & wasn't as creamy as it could've been since parts of it were frozen & other parts were just cold. The pesto wasn't too flavorful. The meyer lemon gave it a very nice tang.For entree, we ordered a half portion of the bucatini pasta & the 3 lb salt crusted branzino. We were definitely disappointed by this dish. We were searching everywhere for the sea urchin (think they missed it on our plate). The pasta & sauce itself was nothing special. The star of this dish was the tiger prawn, for sure. It was big, juicy, & flavorful! The branzino was good (but not the best we've had). It was carved tableside & came with a light green salsa & lemon salt. It was perfectly cooked, & so so delicate. The salsa & salt paired so well with the fish, & really made it shine. The best part of our meal was the dessert. We ordered the tiramisu & they comp'ed us a lemon dessert for our anniversary. The lemon tart was good & light, but couldve used more tartness. The tiramisu was just WOW. It's not your standard, homemade tiramisu. It was more chocolatey & decadent & we loved it so much we had to get another order! Honestly, we may come back just for dessert. Overall, we had a wonderful experience here. The meal itself wasn't too memorable, but the service, experience, & dessert really made it an anniversary celebration to remember.",4,0,0,0

"Dina A.","10/19/2020","Maitland, FL","This place is a bit of a hidden gem considering its location. The google advertising certainly did its job this time. I was staying in Georgetown area of DC and was determined to try some good seafood. Considering that it is close to Baltimore, I thought seafood would make sense for my first trip to the area. The GPS had a hard time finding it, but after asking some locals we finally found the waterfront of the Potomac River and the beautiful waterfront restaurant Fiola Mare. The staff was very festive and professional. Everyone exhibited themselves as if they were royalty. This was prominent in the way they carried themselves, held on to the conversation, and predicted your needs and questions. This aspect really added to the festive and upscale atmosphere of the venue. Anyways, enough of the presentation. Here is the food overview. The menue was large enough for you to choose, but not overwhelmingly large like cheesecake factory, and the names were not confusing. I dined with my g/f so we split some grilled garlic squid. It threw me off at first as I usually order grilled octopus or fried squid, but not grilled squid. I asked the server about it and she encouraged me to try it. I am really happy I did. I honestly think it was better than grilled octopus. The pieces of the squid were large and tender. They were seasoned and marinated well and really addicting. Perhaps this was the best or second best squid dish I have ever had. Anything close to it, I tried in southern Italy. For dinner I got the signature dish of Lobster Ravioli. Let me just make this clear... This was not your frozen lobster ravioli from Costco or Olive Garden. Nothing wrong with those by the way. These particular lobster ravioli had huge chunks of lobster inside and no other filler. There was no cheese or some other starchy material inside. It was pure lobster meat wrapped in a tender and finely shaped ravioli. The entree only had two of them. Sounds ridiculous considering the price of $50 plus but honestly, it was so worth the splurge. The ravioli was presented in a unique flavored red lobster colored sauce with some chives in it. It was very tasty as well and went well with a side of the house smashed potatoes. Yes, smashed, not mashed, and they were amazing too. We didnt get desert as we planned on going to the Georgetown cupcake place, but thanks to the Corona Virus, they were closed. Cant wait to come back to DC and eat at Fiola Mare again, or maybe try their sister restaurant in Miami.",5,1,0,0
"Janay M.","10/22/2020","Washington, DC","We had a great time celebrating our anniversary here recently. They have patio seating and there is also a covered patio with windows and ceiling fans in addition to the regular indoor seating. We chose the covered patio area. We got the benefit of indoor comfortable seating and that fresh air and ventilation you want during this pandemic. The service was excellent start to finish. They gave us complimentary champagne, appetizer salads, and a desert item. We had the lobster ravioli, branzino, potatoes, and spinach. The ravioli was flavorful and tender. The branzino combo was very tasty and we liked the sides also. Everything complemented each other. I think I enjoyed the desserts here most of all. The donuts and the tiramisu were AMAZING.",5,0,0,0
"Maureen W.","10/22/2020","Fairfax, VA","First and last time dining at this restaurant.  I feel that we were swindled by the server, Joshua.  Since the sun was so bright, it was difficult to read the menu on the cell phone. I asked if they have a lunch special and was told no only to discover they have a 3 course price fix on the online menu.  The colors of autumn salad was nothing to write home about for the price.Once seated the server asked if we wanted water, little did I know that he was referring to bottled water as it wasn't specified until he returned with an open bottle. I should have refused as $9 is absurd for water.  I feel like we were taken advantage of and will not recommend this restaurant.  I left a $16 tip as he brought the credit card machine to the table and only allowed for 20, 22, and 25% tip, which the service didn't even come close to the tip left.",1,0,0,0
"Jas A.","10/26/2020","Washington, DC","This is a great place for a celebration. First and foremost, the service is amazing. Friendly, attentive, warm, etc -- the folks working there know what they are doing. The food was also very good. We went for brunch and sat right by the water. We started with the pastry basket and got a few different dishes to share, and finished off with some donuts for dessert. The pastry basket and ricotta pancakes were my favorite. The brunch is not as traditional as some other spots - there is no plain scrambled eggs option or something simple, but that is to be expected. Everything has a unique touch and lots of great seafood. Just be sure to check the menu before you head over for brunch so you aren't expecting eggs and toast but then are surprised by innovative dishes. I would definitely recommend for a special occasion or if the weather is nice and you can snag a spot outside. I have zero complaints, even the coffee was freshly brewed and perfect, which I usually find is not the case when I go to brunch. Be sure to check out the prices since you will spend more than a usual brunch (or dinner I would assume), but you get the ambiance, service, quality, and view of the waterfront.",5,0,0,0

This was partly my fault, because I probably shouldn't have ordered a meat dish at a seafood place, but I was excited since I've never had it before. The waiter also said it was amazing when I asked him about it. It was terrible. Tough, and under-seasoned. The whole balance of the dish quite didn't sit right with me. I ended up using some of the salt from my husband's grilled seafood to make it a little better, but I was struggling to finish it... definitely not worth the $$$. Overall, his seafood dish was great, my steak was terrible, and our 2 raviolis were good but not worth the price tag. It was nice for a one-time visit.",2,4,3,1

"Tanya L.","12/3/2020","Rockville, MD","Ughhhhhhhhh, this pains me to write this.  After having one of THE BEST DINING experiences of our lives at Fiola (see my review to see what I mean), we really looked forward to going on our first date during this pandemic this past August...like REALLY looked forward to it.I scored a reservation easily, left our big kids in charge of the little kids, and we escaped for a couple of hours for the first time since quarantine began.  I had been eyeing Fiola Mare for a while, even before we went to Fiola, so I was super excited.Hosting staff were great.  COVID protocols were in semi-complete (more to follow) with a temperature check.  Sanitizer was placed at the host station as well.  We were placed in front of a less-than-desirable spot (in front of the monitor) right next to the front door on the porch...and also next to a mini waiting area...where some guests waiting decided to wait without their masks on, even talking to staff they knew working and no one told them to put their masks back on...again, this is right next to our table.Our server was often nonexistent (even for COVID standards) and not very warm nor attentive (again, giving some slack for COVID standards).  He was closer to the polar opposite of the AMAAAAZING service we had at Fiola (again, that was pre-COVID too).  We each went with the Adriatic Mixed Seafood Grill, the standout in the mix for both of us being the squid...which was cooked to ABSOLUTE perfection!!!  The branzino was very good although almost a hair overdone and the prawns were definitely cooked a wee too long.  We shared a side of summer corn, which was good but nothing to write home about.We left thinking it was a ""glad we tried it but probably not again"" place, which is sad considering I cannot wait to get back to Fiola and how that experience was beyond amazing.  Both service and food were not what was expected for a Trabocchi establishment.  I'm hoping it was an off-day since I know our experience isn't reflective of the all the glowing reviews.  I just wish our first date of the quarantine had also been as amazing as others had experienced.",2,5,3,3

"Justine S.","1/1/2021","Annandale, VA","It's been awhile since I dined out & came here a few weeks ago for brunch in the festive outdoor igloos with my cousins for a bday + holiday celebration. Logistics: Reservations required. 2hr time limit. Six people are allowed to an igloo and the server (masked) does not step inside unless you allow him too. It is heated as well & has speakers for music. There is a zip window you can open for air, as the door remains closed. They use a machine that purifies the air after every reservation. Food: We ordered about six entrees to share and it was more than enough for the four of us (plus 2 kids). Everything was delicious - The white truffle risotto is my number one recommendation #treatyoself - just do it, the carbonara, lobster roll, mussels, spaghetti with red sauce, & lobster ravioli were all great as well. They provided extra croissant bread (soo good) and gave complimentary amuse bouche then dessert for the bday girl/the kids even though we declined. So thoughtful. Also - their Bloody Mary was on point, per my sis in law. Service: way above par! Our server was the best. He was timely, entertaining, gave us space, and checked on us every so often. He also was very sweet to the kids. Overall had a great experience here.

Other staff members were around to help while Maly took his break, and they were just as kind and knowledgeable.

"Yiran Z.","2/2/2021","Rockville, MD","From a retired food critic, and someone who had dined at Fiola Mare since 20152.5 stars out of 5I visited Fiola Mare on two different occasions in 2020. And the last time was in January of 2021. The first two times were disappointing. But the third time was a lot better but not quite there yet.The first visit was in April for takeout. The quality has gone  way down. The pasta doesn't have much flavor, just BLAND.2nd time, My friend ordered the salmon scramble eggs but it was too salty and you'd assume that they would just take that off the bill right?Oh well, that didn't happen, didn't offer to remake the eggs either. 3rd time Was a lot better, a lot of new people working here. They might benefit from more training. It was busy day on Saturday, last week. But still, 30 mins waiting time for a glass of Bellini? The food quality has gone up. But I don't know if I want to come back again.",3,2,0,0

"Ryan S.","2/27/2021","Washington, DC","Walking in to Fiola Mare today I had absolutely no expectations, the plan was simply just to show up and eat. This place had been on my radar for quite a while and today was the today I pulled the trigger and went. I am so happy to report that Fiola Mare was an absolutely amazing experience today, and one of the best I have had in DC. For today's meal it was my wife, 10 month old daughter and me. It was nice to see how accommodating they were to us while having our young daughter and her stroller. They removed a chair from the table so that we could keep her stroller close to us and socially distanced from the next table over. The food was the real star of today's visit. I enjoyed the cacio pepe while my wile enjoyed the bolognese and my daughter enjoyed both of them. Both dishes were really packed full of flavor,cooked to perfection and presented beautifully. One thing I have never really tried before was langoustines and happy to report that it was delicious as well and right on point with the rest of the meal. The service was was like every other aspect of the meal... perfect. I truly enjoyed our served taking the time to talk to us and explain everything in detail. Very friendly and really added to the overall experience. A very COVID-19 compliant restaurant, all safety measures are in place and followed. I am very happy to recommend this restaurant to all who read this review. Truly a wonderful experience today and I would not hesitate to go back. Please go and enjoy!!",5,8,1,5

"Molly S.","4/4/2021","Villanova, PA","Where should I begin...this was my first visit to Fiola and my friend whose dined there before said the food is great!I'll start with all the positives: beautiful decor, scenic and spacious outdoor seating, and heat lamps at the tables. Biggest compliment goes to the Chef and kitchen staff at 3pm on Saturday; food is EXCELLENT!Negatives: worst server I've ever had and terrible management communication. To start, we had a reservation with several email confirmations, but host didn't find our reservation regardless of the emails they had sent. It was 3pm on Saturday; not their busiest so not a huge issue. After being seated, we waited a while before our server appeared. I told him I'd like ice water with lemon and he pushed Panna on me, I repeated, ice water with lemon. While he was there, we ordered Burrata, knowing it would be awhile before we saw him again. After another 3 mins or so he returned with a bucket of ice and the Panna lol! I didn't make a fuss, I was thirsty. He walked away and we sat for a bit and I told me friend to order for me while I went to the restroom. When I returned, a food runner brought the burrata with table side made pesto sauce; INCREDIBLE! Huge portion but only came with two small pieces of toast. We finished the toast and looked for our waiter so we could ask for more bc there was a ton of burratta left. After 15 mins, our waiter was still no where to be seen. I saw another server who was very attentive to his table and asked him if he could bring us the bread bc we hadn't seen our server and he was delighted to help us. As soon as our waiter caught wind that we spoke to another server, he suddenly appeared and I told him we would like more bread and we'd also like our drinks we had ordered 20 mins ago. I'm assuming he forgot to put them in, bc I know the other competent servers would have brought our drinks had they seen them sitting at the bar. When our food finally came, they brought two Artic Char's. We ordered one Artic Char and one Eggs Benny. We told the food runner, who apologized and removed one of the Artic Char's. Our server then appeared and said it would take a few and my order would be out. He didn't apologize though. What's frustrating is that my friend had to eat his fish or it would get cold. No manager came over to apologize. My friend didn't want to eat his food alone and but I insisted he eat so it didn't get cold. By the time my food had arrived he was finished with his fish and now I had to eat alone. Our waiter never came over once to ask us how our food was and never asked us if we needed anything EVER! After my food arrived our waiter should have come by to see how it was and if everything was alright, a manger should have come as well. Funny thing is, we never saw our waiter after that. My hope is he was let go. A bus boy removed our plates and asked if we wanted to dessert. When we declined, the bill came immediately as did the credit card pickup. We were never asked if we need refills on drinks, it was just really terrible customer service, besides the neighboring server who brought us bread so quickly. Look, dining for 2 hrs at 3pm isn't usually normal, but I get long dining based on how expensive this restaurant is. It's very expensive! I wouldn't have an issue with the expense because the food is great, but for this kind of expense, the service should be A+. I think service is just as important if not more important than the food. I expected management to come over and apologize, but it just shows you how little they care about our returned business or that I would write a review explaining how little their management cares about their customers. Again, hats off to an amazing chef and kitchen staff, you made delicious food!!! Hopefully the chef can explain to his servers and managers that he is making your restaurant look bad.",1,5,2,2

"Treshea L.","4/24/2021","Upper Marlboro, MD","My husband brought me here for our first date on October 19, 2019. Fiola Mare was the 2nd chapter of our love story. I'd say the first was when we actually met about a year before that first date :). The service here, led by Stefania, is impeccable. These folks are completely on top of it. I've said this about maybe one other restaurant, but the servers check in just enough. Not too much to where it's overbearing and not too little to the point of feeling like you're being ignored or unserviced. My husband (just my friend at the time) and I stayed here for HOURS. We were here from lunch time through their preparation for dinner. No one came up to us and asked us to leave. The server actually kept serving us water as we just sat there and talked. Eventually, when things got quieter outside, we looked around and saw that we were the only ones there and decided to roll out. It wasn't the end of our date, but the beginning of a journey.Fast forward to November 7, 2020. My husband and I, just married that morning, decided to circle back to Fiola Mare to celebrate our new union together - just us two like our first date. It was the most beautiful November day! They were following all Covid-19 restrictions, so we weren't concerned about a lack of awareness. We enjoyed our time immensely. The service was amazing as expected, and the food was spectacular. They served us glasses of champagne on the house. I believe they served us a few glasses each (I know I had a few lol!), and Stefania came over to talk to us for a few and told us to let her know if we needed anything. They also let us try something that I don't think was on the menu, and I don't remember what it's called - I just know it was so good! My husband and I loved it!If you have been eyeing this place, just give it a try on a night you want to pamper yourself or yourself and your partner. My husband and I will be returning soon!",5,0,0,0

"Tracy L.","5/1/2021","Rockville, MD","Today was my 5th time dining here and I had to write this. I normally don't review 'need improvements' places but I have to this time, given an upscale restaurant in Georgetown. The spaghetti we ordered was extremely salty. We told the waiter about it. Instead of acknowledging and telling us that he would tell the chef and offered a replacement, he went on to explain that the pasta was cooked by juices extracted from clams and that's why it's salty. First of all, we are not eating clams for the first time so I don't think the level of saltiness of the pasta was from clams. Secondly, we don't appreciate how the waiter handled the situation. When you're in customer service business, you are wrong when customers complain. I'm not saying you're wrong technically, I just don't think the waiter should make a point with customers that it's how it's done. It's not the salty dish, which can be fixed, the issue, but how the situation is handled. I hope this experience would not be repeated with anyone else. We love this place and want to come back.

We've dined there for myriad business lunches, date nights, major milestone events both personal and professional. We've returned for the the delicious food and the extraordinary service. That ended tonight. We were so looking forward to our date night at Fiola Mare. My husband called earlier this week to ask when we could get a table outside for a rare date night (we have four kids). We hoped for Friday or Saturday night but they told us best they could do was Sunday. We both work but we were willing to make it work (pun intended).He specifically asked if we could sit outside and they said they were looking forward to welcoming us back and making that happen.And yet when we arrived we were shown to a table inside. We asked to be moved outside but were dismissed. I think we might have considered staying but it was sweltering inside.

"Dean L.","6/23/2021","Washington, DC","Let me first say that I have long been a big fan of all of Fabio's restaurants, including Fiola downtown, Sfoglina downtown, Sfoglina Van Ness, and, until my last visit, Fiola Mare.Made an 8:45 pm reservation for inside (as opposed to out on the patio) with a note to the restaurant that we were celebrating a special occasion.  We arrived at the restaurant and were shoe-horned into a table across from the wait station and next to a door to the terrace,  which remained open as staff rushed in and out.  It was hot and uncomfortable, so we asked for another table. After a few minutes, were relocated to a table inside, in the corner of a room in front of a curtain which contained linens and a door to an office, again with staff going in and out throughout the meal.  It was almost 10:00 before we received our first morsel of food.  When we finally ordered, the item I wanted, lobster ravioli, is no longer on the menu, and the only reasonable substitute was 86ed for the night. The waiter suggested they could make another dish using mostly the same ingredients.  It was not.  The rest of the food was good, but we were all so aggravated it almost didn't matter.  And that special occasion?  Not surprisingly, it went unnoticed. The service was insulting, at best. Oh, and a message left for a manager to return the call resulted in...wait for it...crickets. Nice way to treat a loyal, repeat customer. Needless to say, we will not be back.",2,2,1,1

The pasta dishes I had - the bucatini and my daughter had the one with clams were over sauced and overpriced for the portion. My husband's bass was very good and nicely prepared. The waiter was not friendly and seemed annoyed. And the worst part, we came for my daughter's birthday which they forgot. We came here for another birthday and we were treated to a glass of Prosecco and a birthday cake slice for my daughter.And why did they remove the photo of Sophia Loren?",1,4,2,1
"Tim L.","6/26/2021","Vienna, VA","If this review were purely based on the food, I'd give more than 5 stars if I could. But there were some problems that should be addressed. First of all, I am no stranger to fine dining and the price that comes with it. However my wife and I brought our kids to Fiola Mare for brunch and both ordered Shirley Temples - we were charged $12 each. That's $24 for 2 sprites with a splash of grenadine. Secondly, the pacing was painfully slow. It was a good 10 minutes after we sat down before we were able to put our order in, despite the restaurant being not even half full. It took 20 minutes for appetizers to come out and another 20 for entrees. We wanted to order dessert, but the meal had already taken 90 minutes (for lunch!) so we had to forego dessert. Additionally, when my main course came out, it had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for an extended period of time - the sauce on top was starting to form a crust and the pasta became over cooked as a result. Third is a complaint about our server. He never told us his name, he was not attentive at all (I actually had to ask other servers to go find him at one point), and he didn't say goodbye after we paid our bill. We requested no chiles in my son's spaghetti but it came with them anyway. He spilled about a quarter of my gazpacho on the floor and made no acknowledgment of it whatsoever. And also we asked for table water - he gave us bottled water and charged us $10 for it. These things are incredibly frustrating and could've ruined the experience, yet didn't. Luckily, the ambiance was perfect - the restaurant is so well appointed and comfortable... not stuffy at all. And the food was absolutely incredible. My youngest son ordered ichabod flat oysters which came dressed in a strawberry mignonette. The oysters were fresh and delicious and the mignonette was subtle and a wonderful compliment. My wife had the scallop crudo in squid ink. It was light and fresh and perfectly balanced. I had the strawberry gazpacho which was very unique - came with panna cotta and sliced strawberries. It had the right amount of acid balanced with sweetness - I loved it. For entrees my youngest son wanted shrimp cocktail - which isn't anything out of the ordinary but the shrimp was fresh, sweet, and tender. My oldest son had the spaghetti aglio e olio, which I thought was fantastic, but as I said earlier was a bit spicy for his taste. My wife had the North Carolina bigeye tuna. It was lightly grilled served with lemon salt and salsa Verde with a side of raw vegetables. This was the lightest and most fulfilling tuna steak we've ever had - just blew our mind. I had tagliatelle carbonara. As I mentioned, the sauce on top began to harden some and the pasta was over cooked as a result of sitting under a heat lamp for too long - but the flavor was so fantastic. Creamy from the egg yolk, earthy from the mushrooms, savory from the cheese. For 3 appetizers and 4 entrees (with the water and Shirley Temples) the total came to $281. All in all this was a great experience. The annoyances noted earlier could've ruined the experience, but the ambiance of the restaurant itself and the quality and flavor of food really saved it. My wife and I will come back for a date night and look forward to more amazing food!",4,0,0,0

"Mickey L.","7/10/2021","Bethesda, MD","After a 7+ year gap, my dining companion and I recently returned to Fiola Mare, dining 3 times within the past 3 months: each significantly better than the previous, capped off by one of the most memorable dining experiences ever for my birthday! Over the years, we had been following FM and observed quite some turnover in the kitchen until current Executive Chef Anton Bolling brought it stability with his superb cuisine. To complement this, service has been very professional while very relaxing, unpretentious, and welcoming. To top it off, the ambiance is fresh, bright, spacious, and lively, a stark contrast to the general gloom of the lockdown era (first two recent visits happening before DC fully opened up).When we first dined at FM on its opening night and ensuing weeks, we were impressed by the quality of pristine ingredients from the sea and impressive desserts that we had come to expect from a Fabio Trabocchi restaurant. However, faults included general over-seasoning and an ever-expanding menu offerings (if overstretched at one point). However, prior to our first visit, we noticed that the menu had become more focus including dish-by-dish.On our first visit, the impeccable quality of ingredients impressed us, including the ""Colors of the Garden"" (gourmet salad with strawberries) and Grilled Calamari (top 2 in our experience) as well as Bomboloni (a favorite since Fiola's opening, when we were first introduced to the unmatched ricotta doughnut) elevated by a caramelly cherry blossom pudding, fior di latte foam, and tart hibiscus sugar. Intrigued, we returned the following month and were further blown away by the Wild Hamachi and Olive Oil-Poached Branzino--among the best raw and cooked fish dishes we have ever enjoyed dining out. The former's natural fish flavor was perfectly accented with citrus, tart begonias, peppery nasturtium, and a sweet-sour meyer lemon coulis. Super refreshing, nuanced, and gorgeously presented, we were so happy we did the rare thing of ordering the same dish. Meanwhile, the Branzino had perfectly sublime texture for maximum enjoyment of the inherent flavors, strikingly paired saffron-ginger broth, melted leeks, and mussels.For my birthday, we chose FM and were beyond impressed! The food and service were even better and more generous with even more special attention to making us feel totally pampered! Food-wise, the Burrata with Nitro Basil-Mint Pesto and Stone Fruits, Lobster Ravioli, Olive Oil-Poached Dover Sole, Potato-Crusted Stone Bass, Tiramisu, and Lemon-Basil Celebration Mini-Cake were the standouts. The Burrata came with a show-stopping presentation of liquid nitrogen poured into a mortar of fresh herbs to be frozen then crumbled for the final flourish. While my DC had been generally unimpressed by molecular gastronomy, this one was a rare exception as the super cold pesto provided an extra layer of texture for the burrata upon contact as well as its theatrical sublimation presentation! As a super special treat, Chef Anton generously sent us tasting portions of Lobster Ravioli (though the huge claw and tail meat were anything but a mere taste!).  Having first enjoyed it at Fiola 10 years ago, we find it symbolic of FM's evolution because it is the best version we had: perfectly seasoned (previously salty) and brightened by a tart mahogany-hued reduction (balsamic?).For mains, the Dover Sole's texture was sublime, and its delicately nuanced flavor perfectly enhanced with a touch of fragrant sweetness from perfectly-ripe cherry tomatoes and fresh corn polenta, smokiness from charred baby corn, tart touch from sungold coulis, and crispness from summer squash!  How divine! The total contrast via meatiness (while tender at the core) was the Stone Bass, pleasantly smoky in aroma from the crust and beautifully hued by saffron-fennel broth with an added layer of starchy sweetness from dates. For dessert, we totally loved the Tiramisu, even more so than on our second visit. From the layers to cute presentation (smiling cup), this is our favorite version of the classic Italian dessert! As the perfect complement to the Tiramisu and Bomboloni (standout all 3 times) was the Celebration Mini-Cake, which was a notch above the previous visit thanks to the sponge cake being soaked in basil syrup that breathed refreshing life into a somewhat plain dish.In terms of service, our first visit with Milan was jolly and fun; the second time with Mirian (now at Fiola) was stellar and very polished; the third with Hakan was truly memorable with him proactively volunteering to take photos of us (we had our camera out) throughout our meal as well as generous pour of Prosecco to perfectly pair with each dish!All in all, FM has gained the exclusive spot in our culinary hearts as our new go-to spot for the most special dining occasions! Furthermore, lunch offers us convenience, terrific value for quality (3-course menu offers LOTS of options), and elegantly relaxed vibes!",5,0,0,0
"Zhicao F.","7/11/2021","Baltimore, MD","Italian-style seafood and brunch restaurant located near Watergate complex and Kennedy Center, right beside the beautiful Potomac river bank. My friends picked this place to celebrate my birthday with me. Service: very friendly and extremely tentative, top-notch. Provided ice to keep our water bottles cool.Drinks: I had a Dolomti draft beer. Crisp, light, but packed with malt and hoppy flavor. Very delightful light beer. My friends' cocktail and mocktail were good as well.Starters: we had scallop crudo (with passion fruit juice) and egg benedict. Scallops were fresh and creamy, literally melted in my mouth. Passion fruit on scallop was a bit surprising, but the sweetness of the fruit and the savory sea-water flavor created a very exciting contrast of flavor. Egg benedict was cooked to perfection, when cut the egg yolk came out like golden lava. Flavor of prosciutto was spot-on. Main course: we came here for the signature seafood tower, Ancona. It came with: two types of oysters, tuna, hamachi crudo, uni (sea urchin), clams, ceviche, scallop, spot prawn cocktail, langoustines, and lobster catana. Everything tasted fresh, but the star of the tower should be the spot prawns and langoustines. Spot pranws were large, meticulously cut and cleaned, and packed with refreshing bites of savory flavor. I've never had langoustines raw, and the two langoustines we got had buttery and savory meat that turned into sweetness in mouth once swalloed. Truly impressive.Desserts: we actually did not order desserts, but the restaurant was kind enough to surprise us with a birthday dessert combo: birthday cake, tiramisu, and pudding. Birthday cake tasted standard, the lemon flavor was refreshing. Pudding was also good. Best of the three should be the tiramisu. Coffee, liqour and sweet cheese flavors could be easily identified, each thick but not overwhelming the others. Overall: I am not sure if this is the first ""zero complaint"" review I've written on Yelp, but my experience is truly zero-complaint. Hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever visited.",5,0,0,1
"Ronald L.","7/16/2021","Silver Spring, MD","They get 2 stars for great ambiance and a super friendly staff. Went here for an anniversary lunch for my parents. Got the seafood ""tower"" which was mostly a bucket of ice with seafood sprinkled on top. The shrimp was ok but the tower was worth maybe 80 bucks at most. If they are gonna charge 215 dollars it should have been 5x as big and should have been way tastier. Got the clam pasta, also a huge disappointment. Burata wasn't very good, I don't care if they use liquid nitrogen, make the food taste good! Anyways if not for the friendly staff I'd give them a one. Only good thing I had was the grilled calamari and the free bread. Oh and they charge 27 dollars for one slice of cake lol. 500 dollar bill for very mediocre food. At least I can say I make better pasta that a Michelin starred place, my wife and parents said they all preferred the pasta I made them the night b4 over the clam one here.",2,3,2,2
"Casey D.","7/18/2021","Georgetown, KY","We visited DC and from lots of recommendations decided to visit Fiola Mare. I expected the ambiance to be very romantic given its location but it had like club music playing which was unexpected and turned out to a fun foreshadowing of our experience there.BT and his partner were excellent salesmen and very knowledgeable about the food/bar products.Our drinks were really good. We had calamari and burrata appetizers. The calamari was the best thing I ate all night. In fact, this has ruined all other calamari for me. I can never eat fried tiny calamari again. Perfectly cooked. The Burrata was excellent and the presentation of food is very theatrical and fun.( a lot of dry ice/smoking dishes here)We had the pasta and branzin, but for me, bc I'd loved the calamari, the pasta dish wasn't as good. I felt like the filling was over seasoned. The branzino was great and I appreciated the attention to detail around getting just the right level of thinness to the potato crust and the right level of crispness to it. We had the donuts for dessert and they were great also.  You can tell a lot of time and effort goes into making the dishes/menu. (Which I expect at this price point) If your looking to plan a special night for dinner or just had a terrible day and need a happy pick me up evening, the food and staff here can do that for you.",4,0,0,1

Of course it's a special place to be able to dine on the Georgetown waterfront and we took in every bit of the ambience as we picked up some fancy drinks on the happy hour for our fourth anniversary.  If we didn't already have reservations somewhere else we probably would have stayed based off of the great time we were having over these drinks, I thoroughly enjoyed sipping my first Manhattan and my wife had the most complex mix of ingredients of a drink that I have ever seen, called the blue sky. I remember it had multiple different herbs as well as cucumber, tea, gin and a few other things that all combined into a sweet, but not too sweet, perfection.  The drinks were $13 on the happy hour and $18 regular price, I have to admit that is overpriced as well as the food that I have seen on their menu but it's a very fancy place so it's expected.  Given the setting and the experience that we had it was more than worth sitting down for a couple of those crafty drinks and I'm sure we'll be back at minimum to try the happy hour spaghetti and calamari the bartenders were also very welcoming and down to earth while maintaining the elegant feel of the restaurant.  Take some special day with a special somebody and splurge, it'll make for a good time.",5,0,1,0

Once seated, we waited 10 minutes for someone to come over to inquire if we wanted sparkling or flat water. Actually, my husband flagged someone down. Our waiter, Michael eventually came over and even apologized for the delay. Okay, fine. We ordered cocktails that were lacking in flavor (but that's our fault for trying something new.)  and the next round stuck with Prosecco and an old fashion--solid choices. The food was delicious. However, we then sat there for easily 30 minutes once we were done and our server never came back to check on us. Someone in a suit finally came over and handed my husband a heavy leather check holder and said ""I'm not sure if you received your check yet but here you are."" Excuse me? Maybe ask if we'd like coffee or dessert  or offer me a to go container because I clearly had plenty of calamari left on my plate. Needless to say, I won't be going back.

Great drinks and service at the bar...then finally seated outside at the upper deck level. Ordered our two entrees and got our drinks and didn't see our sever for 45+ mins.  Eventually our dishes came out, my crab rotolo was embarrassingly cold. The bisque was cold as Andalusian gazpacho. Our sever never apologized for the tardiness..just gave us another order of our drinks and free dessert. The 2nd drinks were way too sweet and I was allergic to the dessert.

"Benjamin T.","8/25/2021","Rockville, MD","I can not express how much my wife and I enjoyed this restaurant.   We came here for an Anniversary dinner and had a great time!    The decor was up my alley with the new age nautical theme.  Think Cafe Del Mar in Ibiza mixed with an upscale yacht club.The wine selection was extensive with a sommelier on duty on a random Tuesday night.    I had few by the glass pours and they were solid choices for ready to go wines.   My wife had the Sexy fish, the presentation was beautiful and it didn't stop there.  The cocktail itself was eclectic with a blend of many different flavors that worked well with keeping you refreshed and buzzed.The appetizers we ordered were the under the sea and lobster crudo.  The under the sea include two piece of each raw selection.  Who knew that raw prawn taste so good!   That Australian Tuna was also top notch!    As for the lobster crudo.  I couldn't tell if I liked the calamansi/lemon or blood orange sauce better with this beautifully presented lobster.    The Hakkido scallops were filling and cooked to perfection.   Again,  the sweet citrusy sauces complimented the seafood perfectly during these last few sweltering summer days.The Adriatic grilled platter has to be a top seller and for good reason.   Every piece of seafood on that plate was amazing!  If you do not know what you want.  Just get this.  Or if you want to add an extra dish for others to share.  This is a great addition that showcases some of their wonderful seafood!The potato encrusted Branzino was the closest you can get to the salt  encrusted Branzino without ordering a whole 4lbs fish.    I will say that the fish came out perfectly fluffy.   The white wine sauce with saffron went well with the Manila clams.   The fish itself is surrounded by a whipped frothy version of the already light sauce.    This was a great move as it was lighter than the tender fish.   Don't sleep on the caponata side.   The vegetables were fresh and complimented the seafood perfectly.As for dessert!   You may be tempted to go with the tiramisu.... I'm sure it's good. However, turn the page of their dessert menu, which is a book by the way.    There is a ""chocolate tower"", it's pretty much a Rocher cake!!!!   It's worth the $30+ a slice.   Heck, my birthdays coming up and I may give them a call to try to purchase a full one!Whatever you get!   Get the chocolate tower for dessert!   Finally,  the final angle of the dinner which throws this review into 5 star territory.   The service.    Everyone was friendly!   I had a seat overlooking the main line and kitchen.  Dishes were flying out of the kitchen at a good pace.    The ambiance was controlled and everyone was having a good time.One of the easiest 5 star ratings I've given in a while!",5,5,2,5

"Annie D.","8/29/2021","Fairfax, VA","We went here for our 11 year anniversary.  The restaurant was overcrowded and we were seated in between two columns with what felt like an aisle and were packed in with diners behind us and booth diners right of us.  Additionally, directly facing us in a booth seat was a female patron in ripped jean shorts, halter top that bared her tummy and back and sneakers.  It was very off-putting to celebrate an anniversary dinner confined to a tight space while having to face that patron for our nice dinner.  It look like the patron had walked off the street after sightseeing and ended up here. I understand there isn't a strict dress code but to see a diner dressed like that and seated in a prime spot by the booths with water view was a total turn off in what is supposed to be a nice restaurant.  We complained to the host when we were done with dinner and they seemed apologetic and said with covid they're just trying to get customers to come back.  Well, they've just lost us as future customers.  While food and service were good the ambiance was totally lost due to this.   The waiter didn't ask if our dinner was a special occasion and seemed busy.  It was one of the most expensive dinners we've had in DC (and we've been to most of the top restaurants over the years) with the poorest ambiance.  Maybe it was better before the pandemic but we will not be spending our money here again.",2,1,0,0

"Leela V.","9/9/2021","Washington, DC","I'd like to tell a specific story that left me floored. My hubby had a business dinner at Fiola Mare with some folks the other night and I asked him to bring home one of the pastas (the mancini spaghetti vongole). It was SOOOOOO GOOD. SO SO SO GOOD. The next night, I was craving that pasta so I put in an order online, along with some other dishes, and asked hubs to pick it up. When he arrived, the order wasn't ready and they said that it must have fell through, but they would make it now. Not a problem, hubs could wait. When hubs finally came home he told me Fiola Mare refunded the ENTIRE cost of the meal! (This was a $100+ order!) I asked hubs if he was adamant enough about them not needing to do that, and that he appreciated the gesture, he said he did but they insisted. This is just UNHEARD of! Not only is their food off the charts but that was so kind of them to refund an entire order when they didn't have to. Great food + a phenomenal operation.",5,1,0,1

"District R.","9/19/2021","Washington, DC","This one's from my spouse: I have never written a review for any product or service.  Our incongruous experience at Fiola Mare last weekend prompts me to break this habit.  One of our most cherished dining experiences in DC pre-COVID was at this restaurant.  Impeccable service, exquisite ambiance, great food, a true experience.  Hoping for another such outing on a very rare date night, we arranged for a baby-sitter and plunked down a $100 deposit to secure a reservation. I booked an outdoor table thinking it would be on the raised platform outside the restaurant overlooking the riverfront boardwalk.  We found out that some of the outdoor tables (where we were seated) are in fact right down on the boardwalk within spitting distance, so to speak, of the crowds on the boardwalk.  This is fine for a bar and grill atmosphere (think Tony and Joe's next door) but if you are paying $28 for an appetizer and $40-50 or higher for an entrée, you hope for a little more.  Our server can best be described as disinterested, curtly answering questions about menu items, and rushing us through our choices.  This may not be a big deal for a basic steak restaurant but for a specialty seafood experience with items on the menu like ""sea robin"" one hopes for a more expansive description.  As for the food, it was excellent but appetizer and entrée portions were tiny (were they always this small?) while desserts were large.  My cocktail had a grand presentation but was filled with a huge ice cube and contained maybe four sips of actual beverage. All told, for a few bites of great food, we got the ambiance of a bar and grill and coffeehouse service for the price of weekend get-away.  It pains us to say this but there is something that doesn't add up here. Hopefully for this (formerly?) great restaurant, it was just an ""off"" night.",2,4,2,1

"Gabrielle L.","9/21/2021","Silver Spring, MD","We enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Fiola Mare. Unfortunately, I failed the Yelp community and took zero photos but I hope that serves as a testament to how delicious our meal was. We were outside overlooking the water. It was quiet and a beautiful warm day. The only downside to the entire meal was the smell of fumes from the tour boats based on the water that unload/load near the restaurant. It is nothing the restaurant has control over but something to know should this change your seating choice. The inside of the restaurant was airy and  tables were well spaced.One note- they have their regular menu along with a pre-fix lunch. Two of us ordered from the fixed lunch menu. I'll also note that their wines by the glass are cheaper when you go for lunch which was an unexpected, pleasant surprise. The fixed menu is $45 with additional supplements available. We enjoyed the burrata. The food was great but what knocked the plate out of the park was the presentation. Mint and basil are nitrogenated (is that a word?) table side and immediately served. This firms up the burrata a bit and compliments the flavors nicely. We also ordered the bluefin tuna tartar. There was an added cost for this dish but completely worth it. For entrees, we ordered the branzino  and cavatelli. The cavatelli appeared handmade and perfectly al dente served in a rich tomato-based sauce. The branzino, however, was grilled and the superior dish amongst the two. I generally have a rule to avoid ordering the same thing as my husband and as wonderful as the pasta was, I certainly regretted it this day! Lastly, the desserts were HUGE and amazing. I had the bomboloni. The donut-hole-sized homemade donuts were warm and covered in cinnamon sugar. What took this dessert to the next level was the budino. It was possibly one of the richest desserts I've ever eaten and I loved every second of it. That richness was also present in the tiramisu. I'm not a tiramisu fan but if everyone made it like Fiola Mare, I would be ordering it far more often. Looking forward to going again.",5,2,1,1

The owner and chef, Fabio Trabocchi, provides a wonderful Italian feast along the waterfront marina at Fiola Mare. The menu winds through various Italian coastal dishes, and each offering is distinct. The nitro pesto and cinnamon granola in the burrata, a dish prepared right in front of us with liquid nitrogen, pairs nicely with the honey-nut squash agrodolce; while a richer, more piquant Adriatic seafood mix swims in deliciously juicy citrus. We were sooo happy with everything we ordered and the presentation was awesome.And lest we forget dessert.... omg! The campfire sundae was out of this world with toasted marshmallow, caramel popcorn, and smoked sea salt. The aroma of smoking rosemary circling the plate put us in a trance.

"Maryann K.","11/20/2021","Reston, VA","I would actually give this visit 3.5 stars is the system allowed. Let's start with the positives. We rented one of the outdoor igloos for my birthday brunch. Igloo rental price does not go towards the cost of food and they do a great job of communicating that. Igloo setup is great with heaters, stylish decor and a view of the river. Great people watching. Bottomless brunch is a good value. Great variety of breakfast and lunch items on the menu. I had the tuna tartare and the veggie gluten free pasta. Flavors were amazing. I was in heaven from that standpoint. Unfortunately, they do not have any gluten free dessert options other than sorbet. I expect better from a restaurant of this caliber. Made for a sad bday dessert. Service was terrible. The server definitely had time because he spent most of it in the next tent over. Not sure if he was friends with the other diners? In any case, there was an issue with bar and we didn't have any champagne to drink while eating our entrees. Server could have been running interference with the bar if he wasn't so busy with his friends. Also he tried charging us a la carte for items on the brunch prix fixe in addition to the brunch fee. I'd still go back to this place, just not for my birthday. The food is so good I could tolerate bad service in the future, just maybe not with the added igloo rental fee. I love the igloo concept, they just need to work on the service a bit. Igloos are too far removed from the dining room to flag down a manager. I would have much rather addressed this with a manager.

He was very helpful as far as recommendations and I feel like we didn't make one bad choice.We got the Ancona (seafood tower), the burrata, the Mafalde pasta, the Tortelloni Bolognese, a langoustine, an order of Portuguese sardines, and the Branzino Vernaccia. For cocktails we got the Sexy Fish, Amalfi Coast, Spritz in Milano, and the Berry Grazie. The Ancona was pretty lavish and the presentation was amazing. Everything on the tower tasted so fresh. Loved the shrimp and scallops especially. The burrata with the nitro pesto was pretty wild. I mean who even thinks of that! It went well with the popovers that Michael brought to the table. I wish I would've got more of those. The pastas were both unique, nothing we've ever had before. The Tortelloni dish came with a nice broth and the bolognese was inside each tortelloni! The Mafalde was even better with large pieces of octopus and a little crunch I couldn't really identify. I loved the Branzino as well since it was so flaky, tender, and came with a potato crust. My dad liked the sardines and the langoustine but I didn't get to try any. The drinks were all very good, but I think the presentation for the Sexy Fish especially made the drink even better. Michael made dessert sound so good so we had to order the Throwback which was like an elevated PB&J and the Tiramasu. Both were super rich and decadent, I'm honestly glad we ordered both. Lastly I really appreciated not only the small birthday cake/letter from the restaurant for my Dad's birthday but also the custom Happy Birthday menu as well. It really was the small touches that made this experience a 5 star review. I will absolutely be back.",5,0,1,0
"Aarti B.","11/23/2021","McLean, VA","Wonderful sparkling brunch - get the Ricotta Sardinia Cavatelli! The $85 Sparkling bottomless brunch (75 min limit) is a great deal with an app, entree, dessert. My hubby relished the bottomless drinks thanks to the attentive servers who replenished his drink or asked about the next round before he even got to the bottom! I went a la carte, but def getting the sparkling brunch - next time! While the Mimosas were tasty with fresh-squeezed OJ, I actually preferred the in-house Fabio Prosecco and worth the hefty $15 a la carte price tag (Mimosas are sadly $16). I wasn't a big fan of the Sangria, it had a bold Peach schnapps flavor. My hubby really enjoyed the Bloody Mary, but wished he had it earlier in the meal with his hearty Salmon Scrambled Eggs. He also enjoyed the Crab  Bisque. The Fabio G&T (not part of the brunch deal) had a bold citrus flavor with  flower petals, lemon grass, and an orange peel floating in my cocktail that elevated the flavor. Definitely a creative cocktail! If you enjoy gin, go for it! The classic cocktails (not the bubbly brunch) are spirit-forward and pack a punch! You won't find any sweet cocktails on the menu. The warm flaky croissant shaped into a muffin was delicious.  The stone cold Bread Basket was a bit disappointing. I was hoping for some fresh fluffy focaccia bread or warm muffins - it didn't happen. The Apple strudel Danish was tasty and the best out of the bunch. The Ricotta Sardinia Cavatelli is honestly among the best pasta dishes I've had and on par with the restaurants in Italy. It has a great texture but not too dense similar to gnocchi but made of flour and ricotta cheese. The light creamy tomato sauce is perfect for soaking up the little cavatelli noodles accompanied by small chunks of tomatoes and chopped up spinach. All the ingredients pair really well together. The last time I had this dish was 3 years ago around my birthday and it still tastes as good yesterday! The Cavatelli pasta dish is only available for lunch and weekend brunch - wish it was available for dinner! Skip the Tiramisu! The chocolately Tiramisu wasn't my favorite with a thick coat of cocoa powder and topped with chocolate sorbet. It was more like a chocolate cake with cream than tiramisu. Tiramisu is traditionally served in a cup like this rather than the Americanized cake, but it was too chocolately and lots of ingredients and flavors that didn't blend well together. While the swirly ganache topping was very decadent and fun to try and the chocolate sorbet was nice, it was a chocolate overload that I wasn't expecting. Simpler is better in this case. Definitely make a reservation (they don't charge a credit card!) The fancy white table cloth restaurant is definitely worth the hype and can see why the Obamas and Bidens dine here for the delicious food, attentive service, comfy seats, and terrific ambiance with sweeping Potomac River views. Excited to come back for sparkling brunch (will get it next time!) and the Ricotta Sardinia Cavatelli!",5,8,1,4
"Tiffany A.","11/26/2021","Washington, DC","Last week, my husband brought me to Fiola Mare to celebrate my birthday. The evening was an absolute and utter disaster.So everything leading up to the actual food portion of dinner was fine... great service, great wine, etc, etc.. our misadventures started when the food arrived.As soon as the plates hit the table, I knew something was wrong. My husband ordered the prime rib, and it smelled like unwashed a** crack. It had a strange grayish hue, something you would expect from old cafeteria food, not a $75 steak. We both tried a bite, and it tasted like meat that had gone bad and was manipulated as much as possible to try to mask that fact. I ordered the Paccheri Frutti di Mare. I took a bite of the pasta, and it had a crunch to it, as it was undercooked. I tried another noodle, same... hard with a slight crunch. I let my server know the pasta was undercooked, and that the steak tasted off. This is the point where a restaurant usually tries their best to redeem themselves. And this is when everything took a turn decidedly for the worst.The server kept insisting that the steak was fine, but that what we might have a problem with was that it was porcini rubbed steak. The maitre d stopped by to apologize that our food was not to our liking and that the pasta was too ""al dente"" for my taste. NO. No, no, no. You don't get to completely ruin my birthday with terrible food and then proceed to gaslight me. The steak was old. Good quality meat should never be that color. How do I know? Because I have eaten at many steakhouses and have cooked my own steaks at home, from basic grilled steaks to dry aged reverse seared tomahawk ribeyes. Also, even if we make the assumption that the steak was not off, whatever chef could make the decision to prepare the meat that way to make it smell and taste like an unwashed used gym sock should not be allowed to cook anymore. It's not because we don't like the flavor of a porcini rub. You don't get to make this about us not having a sophisticated palate.. the steak was old and prepared terribly, so just apologize and move on. Right? Nope.They prepared the pasta for me again, and it was still undercooked. I'm starting to question myself, is this how this pasta is supposed to be? My husband had switched his order to the cacio e pepe, and I tried one of his pasta noodles. His was perfectly cooked.. okay, so mine is still decidedly undercooked. At this point, I'm getting embarrassed so I just push the pasta aside and try to eat the frutti di mare portion of the plate. That's when I realize, not only is the pasta undercooked (again), the dish doesn't taste great either.. it doesn't taste like anything at all. And based on what Fiola MARE stands for, the most offending part of the dish is that the seafood is rubbery... which is not the sign of fresh seafood, but indicates to me that it had been frozen.I have dined at Fiola Mare several times in the past. They used to have some of the freshest seafood in DC, prepared simply but elegantly and deliciously, worth the high price tag and reserved for special occasions. What I experienced last week was really a travesty. This restaurant is now not only serving old food, but has completely lost its inspiration. The food tastes bad, period. You know how I know the staff already knows they are hawking a shit product? The fact that they resort to blaming the victim ahem diner for not liking said shitty food. They already emailed us, asking us to come back to try and fix things, but honestly I respect myself too much to ever go back.",1,0,0,0

Absolutely loved every bite of the pasta. Wonderful flavors. We closed out lunch with the Bomboloni (Donuts) and lattes. The donuts are served warm and best smothered in the sauce.I highly recommend going on a long walk around the neighborhood after finishing up here. You're paying for the service and location.

We stopped in today before a day out in Georgetown for a nice brunch and chose to do the $85 Sparkling Brunch, which includes bottomless mimosas/brunch cocktails, a pastry basket, an appetizer, entree, and dessert--and it was beyond worth the money. The quality, service, and taste were all amazing! We also had no problems with truly having bottomless mimosas--our drinks were full at all times!To start, we had the burrata and crab apple bisque. Both were shockingly good and the burrata is so instagrammable-get your cameras ready for it! Then, we had the eggs benedict and the tagliatelle carbonara. The eggs benedict was the standout dish of the morning, with fresh shaved truffle. It was to die for. Finally, we ended with the tiramisu and bomboloni. Each were rich and delicious, but we couldn't finish because we were so full! Additionally, our server Michael was so friendly and warm.

"Elizabeth H.","1/9/2022","New York, NY","I will keep this concise to the pros and cons. I will not be coming back again and these are the reasons. pros: - it acts like a high end restaurant but that should expected because it is a Michelin rated restaurant   - the waiter was very helpful in choosing food and recommendations- the ambiance is great (low lighting, quiet enough to have intimate conversations, etc.)- the service staff was great- the bread and the dip was delightful. cons: - the uni (sea urchin) was completely ruined in its strong flavors and seasonings. Sea Urchin is one of those dishes that can hold its own because of its unique flavoring and texture. Unfortunately, the dish that contained sea urchin was completely underwhelming and disappointing as the pieces did not taste like the full sea urchin taste but instead was cut and tasted like it was the end pieces that is heavily seasoned because it is not as fresh. I do not know how fresh it is, but the heavy seasoning destroyed the essence of the sea urchin and took away from the rareness quality of uni, which really pains me to write as the sea urchin is one of top favorite seafood and food. Also, I am not sure if the sea urchin was even imported from Japan? If it was, the taste and texture was ruined. Given this is a ""high end"" place, this is highly disappointing. - The truffle did not taste like what it should. Truffle is expensive for a reason. It is supposed to have a certain flavor but once it is past the ""season"" which lasts about 6 weeks from January, it should not be served past its peak times as it destroys the flavor completely. Just look up the best chefs in the world and they will validate this. It is useless to eat truffle when it is NOT in season and not at its peak of its flavor. I was surprised to see it on the menu when it was past its season but decided to try and be open minded, but was highly disappointed. The fish was also DRY. - the pasta was good but it was nothing mind blowing for what the rating is for this place. I ate all of it but I have been to family owned Italian restaurants that have had MIND BLOWING pasta and flavor that just blows in your mouth. I am confused as to what this place is supposed to be known for, because the seafood is terribly disappointing and there are other seafood restaurants for 1/4 of the price but has its sea urchin delivered and imported directly from Japan on a weakly basis. Why is it seasoned so that the essence of the flavor is completely destroyed? Honestly, go to other michelin rated places in DC (there are many in DC) because this place is not worth it at all for its price and what it claims to do",1,0,1,0

Le Diplomate and Oyamel are significantly better experiences with better food and for a fraction of the price. Again, I really do not understand how a prefix for two with a glass of wine was 700 dollars.

"Teresa C.","2/17/2022","Washington, DC","Beautiful location right by the water with excellent service, Fiola Mare is the fancy seafood place you take your parents for mother's day or your girlfriend for a special occasion. Favorites: The seafood tower was huge (albeit pricy at nearly $300) and comfortably shared between three people, would not be enough for everyone to try the different cappaccios given that they're served in portions of 3. But the seafood was all fresh, the flavors interesting, and the metal octopus a fun way to serve it for the table. Bread - you're paying $7 for three cruffins and you'll do it, because it's the only thing you're paying less than $10 for on this menu. (Still worth it.) Octopus malfade pasta - so innovative and unique, I loved every bite of saucy  pasta. You really can't go wrong with this cult favorite here, unless you're allergic to seafood (in which case, why are you here? Go check out regular Fiola.)We tried the valentines day dessert which was a beautiful chaos of raspberry, sorbet, chocolate, and sweetness. No regrets, except for sharing. it with people. The cocktails were good, but mindblowing? Not really. Crowdpleasers was the Juliet.Get a table at 5 when they open and ask for a couch spot by the water.

The restaurant was very full, and the tables were close together. The lighting was intimate but not dark. There are different sections for seating and a large bar area. They had a lovely Valentines special, but I'm not a fan of lobster, so we didn't select that option for two. We started with cocktails. We each had the Spritz in Milano. It was delicious! It was sweet and savory. For an appetizer, I had the Butternut Squash Vellutata. It is soup dish with poached apple, pine nut gremolata and gingerbread. The flavors were immaculate! It was a great start to my evening. My husband enjoyed the Wild Bigeye Tuna. For an entree, I chose the Jumbo Black Tiger Prawns. Our server recommended they I order 2 and that was plentiful. They were cooked perfectly. My husband ordered the Adriatic Mixed Grilled Seafood and thoroughly enjoyed the full selection, including lobster (he is a fan of it!) we ordered bread as well: Spirale di Pane, which was good.

Food was excellent  the restaurant has gorgeous interiors But the service could be better. The potatoes didn't have salt in them. We brought it to the servers attention but by the time he came by it was too late in the meal, we asked for extra salt and just used that on top of the potatoes. We were not offered a replacement for the salt less potatoes. Also husband got sick a couple hours after lunch, not sure why. We sent this feedback via email but didn't get any response.",3,1,0,0

It had a great spicy kick to it and the pasta was cooked al dente. We finished our fantastic meal with their Tiramisu.  They also provided us with Gelato.  The drinks are one of their strong points and their Smoked Old Fashioned presentation and taste was definitely a WOW factor.  A big shout out to all the wonderful servers and staff.",5,6,3,4

"Alice M.","6/21/2022","Weehawken, NJ","We came here for lunch during our  weekend in DC. We wanted something seafood based and and this place had great reviews despite being a bit pricey. We made our reservations and had a little trouble finding the restaurant. Food: We didn't have any of the pasta or main entrees but the seafood tower made up for it. It was absolutely amazing! But even before that we started with caviar :). We were also recommended a wonderful bottle of wine based off of our particular taste. It was also moderately priced and we thoroughly enjoyed it.Pros:-Delicious seafood!-Great variety of seafood-Nice caviar spread -Caviar toppings though were lovely!Cons:-Blinis were too thick and arrived a bit cooler than normal. Service: This left a lot of room for improvement. Firstly, I would just like to say that we loved our waiter. He was great and had wonderful suggestions. However, the hostesses in the front were a bit harsh in tone and attitude. We asked if we could have a table by the window and were told there was a 30minute wait, despite two tables being open. They then sat us all the way in the back of the restaurant where there was no one. We asked if we could move up one seating so as not to be completely by ourselves. The hostess seemed bothered and said she would need to change the waiters then, mind you we hadn't even sat down. We were all just standing in the middle of the seating. Because this made the hostess upset, we sat where she chose for us. The waiter that was assigned to us, was the same waiter serving outdoor tables and had to run back and forth and apologized for the delay. The rest of lunch we sat by ourselves in the back. More and more table became available in front of us. More tables opened by the windows. We continued our lunch in solitude. Moral of the story, avoid the hostesses in blue dresses. Pros:-Waiter was fantastic!!-Great recommendationsCons:-Hostess was rude and ruined our experience.",3,1,0,0

"Julia P.","7/10/2022","Laurel, MD","I brought my family here for brunch for a late Father's Day celebration for my dad. The food was great - I highly recommend the branzino alla plancha, tuna tartare, calamari (very soft!), bombolini (donuts) and silician memories (cannoli and gelato). Our server was also great, she was very attentive and nice to us. So for those two, I would give 4.5 stars. The low overall rating is for a very rude host, my dad asked him where the bathroom was (we were seated outdoors), and my brother who was with my dad heard the host (a guy in a suit, wearing glasses) say something along the lines of ""oh so you don't need to be a paying customer anymore to use the bathroom"". I don't know if he was being racist or what but wow, we were dressed nicely, we always do, and we were still looked down by this person. But it doesn't matter how you are dressed, you still don't make snide remarks like that around fellow human beings. With that said, I don't think we would ever come back here again because my brother was very visibly upset throughout the meal, his hands were trembling as he ate, and thankfully we were able to calm him down.

"Shalesia T.","7/14/2022","Newport News, VA","Fiola Mare gets 5 stars- period lol. Every single thing we ordered was DELICIOUS. We had the truffle pasta and eggplant pasta, both were delicious. The truffle pasta has 3 grams of freshly shaved truffles and the eggplant pasta has chunks of fresh vegetables including eggplant (obvi), tomato, and onion with a sliver of fried eggplant on top. For drinks we had the sexy fish which was good but very smoky thanks to the Mezcal fyi and the Sicilian Sunset, which I would order again and again. For dessert we had the bomboloni which was pretty delicious and a slice of lemon sponge cake which was extremely rich so make sure you like lemon, it may have even had a hint of ricotta- overall good. We were given complementary Peach Gazpacho by our waitress- shout out to her, that was very kind.

I can't say enough about the menu, location and generally the atmosphere with the added bonus of being on the Potamic on a perfect evening. The food was absolutely delicious and you have to be careful to limit yourself because you can easily tap out if you get too much up front and you have to save some room for desert. The cocktails were solid too and generally I think my favorite item was a tie between the Michelin star dish Turbo or maybe the Burrata. All of it was good though and I ate entirely too much. The dessert was a fantastic way to cap the night and both the Tiramissu and the Bomba Donuts are a must. Thanks again for helping us celebrate and looking forward to a future visit.",5,2,1,0

So many walks of life passing by creating their own memories. I was mesmerized by the ongoing shuffle of life around me. However, I am here to share the experiences of Fiola Mare with you. The staff are friendly, helpful, attentive, and knowledgable. My waiter, Giovanni, fresh out of Miami walked me thru the menu to be sure I made the best choices for my tastebuds. He did not disappoint. I got the Japanese Madai (?) with a half portion of the Ravioli. Full disclosure, get the full portion of pasta as one can have never have enough. The cream corn sauce was out of this world yummy on the ravioli. The fish was a little over cooked, but it happens and was still enjoyable. I did try their caviar and can honestly say it felt like I was swishing the ocean in my mouth. So yummy! And for the grand finale, I got the chocolate cake the hostess had recommended while sitting me. Whoa! This is not your average chocolate cake! Decadent in ways I was not anticipating.

"Alexis B.","9/13/2022","Baltimore, MD","I had brunch at Fiola Mare a few weeks ago when we came down to DC for a day trip for my husband's birthday. I really loved the experience. A lot of restaurants with great views can be letdowns, like they phone in the food or service because they know people will come just for the view/atmosphere. That is not Fiola Mare. From the welcome at the hostess stand to the getting the check, the service was wonderful. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful (very coastal, beachy), but if the weather is nice, I definitely recommend sitting outside. The outside seating is right off the walking path along the Potomac, and the views of the Potomac River and Theodore Roosevelt Island were wonderful. (It was fun to watch boats come in and dock for brunch right in front of us!) The ambience was wonderful. But they don't phone in the food! The menu is all about the seafood, which I was thrilled about. I wanted everything! We shared the macchi (ruby red shrimp tartare-stuffed pasta shells with pepperoncini, nori pane fritto, and burrata), which blew me away. It's a pricey, small dish, but what a starter! I would absolutely eat it again. Gorgeous, delicious, light,...! Loved. We got two of the brunch entrees to share. One was the occhio di bue (two baked eggs, smoked whitefish, baccala, spicy pomodoro sauce, tigelle modenese), which was tasty - like a fishy eggs in purgatory? It needed additional bread to soak up the sauce and was perhaps too sauce for how much seafood and eggs was in the dish, but overall a good dish. I preferred the swordfish milanese with meyer lemon, capers, shallots, a roasted pepper, a side salad of fennel and radish, and a fried egg. It was a delicious brunch dish! I hadn't had a milanese with swordfish before, and it was a great dish - the swordfish takes to breading very well. Delicious!We wished we had enough room for dessert! But we did enjoy their iced coffee service! (We stuck to coffee at this brunch - but they have great cocktail drink options!)Overall, it was just a very special meal. It's definitely on the pricier side, so it's a great place for a treat or a special occasion! I'd happily return!",5,11,4,12

The food itself was definitely a solid B+ or A-.  The two crudos we sampled had very fresh fish... but were otherwise pretty bland. My pasta was excellent, with perfectly cooked al dente pasta, an eggplant ragu, and tender octopus.  Wines by the glass were outstanding; I had a barolo from Azelia, a producer I love. All this being said, the prices were ridiculously high, like the $50 dozen oysters.

From the moment I walked in the door to the time I left, the staff were extremely respectful and welcoming. Presentation is big here, and I love that. Right on the Georgetown waterfront, Fiola Mare is a short 15 minute walk to the Kennedy Center for those wanting to catch a show. There is a pre fixe theater menu but I decided to go ala carte because there were a couple of items that I wanted from the regular menu. I had the mock tail, which was a refreshing citrusy drink. I hiiiighly recommend the burrata--I didn't know what I was getting into, but the ""nitro pesto"" is made right in front of you! It was really cool to see the basil freeze and hear it crisping after as it was crushed. As per our waitress's recommendation, we got the bread on the side to eat with the burrata. It is like a croissant in muffin form. It's nice to have some bread to eat a block of cheese. I ordered the bigoli spaghetti and my friend ordered the Mancini Spaghetti Alle Vongole. My dish had no meat and but was incredibly flavorful. The pasta had a different texture as if it was handmade and cooked Al dente! I like when the pasta has more of a bite to it. The only downside was that the quantity was much smaller for the Bigoli than the Mancini. Only downside is the premium price tag, but you get what you pay for!",5,0,0,0

"Shirlene C.","10/16/2022","Silver Spring, MD","Our first time at Fiola Mare.  Beautiful location along the Georgetown waterfront.  We were seated just inside the windows with a view of the water and were able to watch the sunset on a gorgeous October day.  The decor and ambiance are upscale without being stuffy.  I ordered the Sexy Fish drink which was delivered with much fanfare on a tray of dry ice.  The drink was good, but the presentation more dramatic than I was expecting.  We got a half dozen Wellfleet oysters and I was dismayed to find the mignonette sauce already on them, as I find it overwhelms the taste of the oysters.  We shared the Colors of the Garden Salad, which was very delicious except for the fruit jelly at the bottom of the bowl.  Much too sweet and gloppy.  My branzino was delicious.  I ordered a glass of the fiano wine and it paired perfectly with the fish.  My daughter's honey nut squash pasta was delicious but very rich.  She could not even finish a half order.  The delicata squash side was very good.  We finished with the Venetian Tiramisu, which was delicious but not a classic tiramisu.  Altogether a generally wonderful experience.",4,0,0,0

"Letta L.","10/25/2022","Virginia Beach, VA","Yesterday we celebrated my dad's birthday at Fiola Mare. I knew what to expect since this was our second time. However, it was better than before. The staff was amazingly courteous and excellent. My dad felt like he was treated right. The customized menu that had the birthday message, the bday card from the owner, the recommended cocktail for him. We all absolutely loved the experience. Of course the food was so so good. We were praising so loudly after each bite so I was feeling a little embarrassed. Lol even if we sat outside, the heater helped us keep us warm. The perfect weather also helped. Thank you Fiola Mare family for making our night yesterday. I can't wait to come back for any special event.",5,0,0,1
"Kutlu S.","10/28/2022","Potomac, MD","Yet another wonderful meal at Fiola Mare... The attentiveness of service, a wonderful wine list, and above all the food... Superb fresh ingredients made into imaginative dishes... Excellent grilled turbot, simple but so flavorful. Pappardelle bolognese to savor. An amuse bouche of a scallop crudo with a sauce of salmon eggs, redolent of the sea. Delightful burrata with herbs served in a very interesting way. Eggplant confit to complement the fish. And finally, the crescendo of the best tiramisu ever.Thank you all.",5,0,0,0
"Cecily B.","10/29/2022","Flagstaff, AZ","Was a little disappointed. Made lunch reservations and asked for table with view. Was given a weird table facing the water while booths on the water stayed open the whole time we were there. Food was expensive, above average. Won't go back.",4,0,0,0
"De57 H.","11/12/2022","Moreno Valley, CA","PROS: Food is amazing! We rented out a room for a meeting and had the best 4-course meal ever! The first one was a tomato bowl then lasagna, then chicken, and the last one with a lemon Berry bowl for dessert! It was perfect! The location is beautiful with lights, water, mermaid-style themed decor with a water front in the downtown area close to Georgetown! I loved everything and the staff were the sweetest! I would go back again and I am not from DC!CONS: NOTHING EVER!",5,0,0,0
"Sania M.","11/12/2022","Chapel Hill, NC","Amazing food and the ambiance is wonderful. I went to dinner here and honestly I can't say anything bad. The tuna tartare was exceptionally good. We had the burrata salad and they had surprise smoke with flavoring and made the pesto right in front of us. I ate the seafood spaghetti which was delicious. Everything was so fresh and wonderful. Also the dessert, I was seriously stuffed all the way to my neck but the tiramisu was divine and i definitely made room somehow. I would highly recommend",5,0,0,0
"Fred K.","11/13/2022","Rockville, MD","Still a 5 star rating. Can't beat the view, the ambiance, and stellar service. I'm so glad that their signature dish, lobster ravioli, is back on their menu permanently. Their brunch menu for $95 (6 years ago it was $48!) for three course and unlimited adult beverages is still a steal. We opted to order lobster ravioli as a separate dish (4 course brunch!). Their new duck scrapple was delicious. You can never go wrong with any of their pastas. My little one devoured her spaghetti and all of the pasta dishes are just fantastic. But you have to eat their lobster ravioli. It's so rich and succulent with the lobster bisque sauce and two big plumps of lobster ravioli and one lobster claw and tail. The branzino fish is like all of the places but it's the sauce and fish roe that makes it stand apart. That fall panna cotta. It's the perfect fall dessert. So freaking good!Awesome fine dining restaurant with great views of the Potomac.",5,4,2,5
"Marcelo S.","11/17/2022","Memorial City, Houston, TX","While in the DC area this restaurant was recommended.As a Michelin 2021 and recognized by Travelers Choice 2020, I wanted to see what all the hype was about With Italian roots, I was interested in seeing how Fabio Trabocchis love of life by the sea  on coastline of Monte Conero inspired his culinary dishes.Food and wine Magazine even recognized best New Chef and recipient of James Beard Award. Located in Georgetown with scenic views of waterfront and its marina.Prefixed  menu with sea bass in their private dining room was memorable .",5,7,1,5
"Christina D.","11/25/2022","Washington, DC","Perfection. My love & I celebrated our 1st anniversary here this week and it was amazing from start to finish. We always loved Fiola and now we can say Fiola Mare is just as exquisite. We highly recommend celebrating any special occasion here.",5,0,0,0
"Xinru T.","11/25/2022","San Diego, CA","Food was just ok (spaghetti was raw and hard in the middle, squash soup was too sweet, salad was too sour...). I personally think Fiola is much better and WORTHIER than Fiola Mare.There were not a lot choices for each type of course on the menu. I've been there twice and tried about ten dishes, and there were only two dishes I would order again. Dining room was noisy. Service was not good, maybe because I came alone. The server obviously paid more attention on party of 2-6. This experience made the tip choices showed on the credit card terminal screen look very funny (20% is the ""suggested"" minimum, although you can choose custom tip). Overall, I probably won't visit it again.",3,0,0,0
"Bernie P.","11/27/2022","Arlington, VA","First, Fiola Mare is not cheap, and I certainly am always happy to find a bargain.  However, on the other hand, you sometimes have to pay for quality and a little ingenuity.  Fiola Mare fits this description extremely well.Scanning my review from last year, very little has changed in terms of our assessment.  I planned to be brief but after editing my review, I failed to do so because I had more to write than I thought.  I'm sorry to the Instagram/ Tick Tock crowd  : - )   For the food, what grabbed us immediately was our first course ""Under the Sea.""  I see we had this when I wrote our last Fiola Mare review, but we did not have it for our last couple of visits, so I have to take a little Yelp real estate for this dish again.  If you like sashimi, I think you will like chef Anton's creation.  It is absolutely amazing!  The quality and mixture of the fish, the texture and crunch of the puffed rice and crispness and freshness of cucumber.  The horseradish is subtle enough to bring out the flavors of the fish. Also, the yogurt helps smooth out and bind the dish together. Can you tell I like this??!!!  The rest of our dishes were flawlessly executed and enjoyed.  The other shoutout I will give since the sea is (well engrained) in Fiola Mare's name:   the duck Rohan!  The duck is perfectly executed, which is not easy, IMHO.  With the breast, there is a great complementary balance of confit and fois gras.  Plus, the cherry jus maximizes the flavor of the breast.  This was an unexpected surprise since the sea is understandably Fiola Mare's focus.Regarding service, unlike so many other restaurants in the DC area over the past year, Fiola Mare still maintains extremely high quality in execution and is blessed with talented staff.  Service for us is an undeniably critical component to the experience.Just like in my last review, we still give shoutouts to Marlon as a server and Megumi as a sommelier.  We followed them to Fiola Mare after first being introduced to both of them at Casa Luca years ago.  Marlon never lets us down by picking the best dishes on the menu for us, and Megumi patiently explains her pairings and teaches me a little something new at each visit.  Spending a little more time thinking about the great service, I know Del Mar (another Fabio Trabocchi restaurant) experienced some worker problems a year and a half ago.  I don't know if the Fabio Trabocchi  restaurants learned from the experience, but Fiola Mare (at least from what I can see) showcases a happy, extremely competent workforce, which is critical to giving the customer a worthwhile experience.  To loop back, this is a time where restaurant staff across the country  are stretched thin because of a lack of talented service providers.  We saw no evidence of that at Fiola Mare, which is worth a lot.For the value analysis, no surprises, Fiola Mare is not cheap, as I already explained, and the price has noticeably increased since the last review to be clear.  The two of us each had five courses (including dessert but not the amuse bouche) and a glass of wine (split between us for each course). The total price including 20%+ tip was about $660.  However, to repeat, quality has its price.  We are big eaters and even we could have eaten a little less, so I'm guessing you can still eat and drink well for somewhat less than our bill. Fiola Mare remains a solidly reliable fine dining choice in DC and remains in our top tier rotation of restaurants.",5,2,0,0
"Jonathan X.","11/28/2022","Washington, DC","I have NEVER been treated so warmly, and kindly as I was at Fiola Mare. This was a very special date night and the staff could not be more kind. A gentleman in a suit brought over a tray of their fresh fish and went through everything. The menu is plentiful with both a raw, and cooked sections. My date loved his Wild Danish Turbot alla Romana, very plentiful and filling. I had the Branzino and it was really well prepared and cooked. Something that really caught my attention, because it seems so rare in DC, were the sheer number of people moving about the restaurant tending to our every need. Not once did I have to look up for a server. Everything was perfectly timed, drinks filled, and just a wonderful, wonderful evening. I've been eating in DC for fifteen years and I can say with great certainty that Fiola Mare went above and beyond.",5,0,0,0
